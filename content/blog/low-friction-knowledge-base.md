# The DIY Guide to Building a Low-Friction Knowledge Base

Whether you're a solopreneur or member of a larger team, you know that every minute counts. You're constantly juggling a million tasks, from content creation to customer support to financial management. And as your business scales, you need a system in place for capturing and sharing knowledge - both for yourself and for any team members or virtual assistants you might bring on board.

You know how it goes:

> "How do I do [X] again?"

Enter the low-friction knowledge base. With just two tools that you probably already use - Slack and Notion - you can create a searchable, scalable repository of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and institutional knowledge.

Here's how it works:

## Step 1: Record a Screen Share Video in Slack

Whenever you find yourself doing a task that you know you'll need to repeat in the future (or delegate to someone else), fire up a screen share video in Slack. Just click the little plus sign next to the message box, select "Record a video clip," and choose "Share screen."

As you walk through the task, narrate what you're doing and why. Pretend you're explaining it to a new hire or a future version of yourself. Don't worry about making it perfect - the goal is to capture the key steps and decision points, not to create a polished tutorial.

## Step 2: Copy the Transcript and Download the Video

Once you've finished recording, Slack will automatically generate a transcript of your narration. Copy this transcript and head over to Notion. Create a new page for the SOP, and paste in the transcript.

Then, download the video file from Slack and upload it to the Notion page as well. This way, you'll have both a written and a visual reference for the procedure.

## Step 3: Transform the Transcript into a Checklist

Here's where the magic happens. With the transcript pasted into your Notion page, use Notion's "Ask AI" feature to generate a step-by-step checklist version of the procedure. Simply highlight the transcript text and select "Ask AI" from the context menu. In the prompt field, type something like:

> "Turn this transcript into a step-by-step standard operating procedure with no steps skipped."

Notion's AI will generate a concise, actionable checklist that captures the key steps from your video. Paste this checklist at the top of your Notion page, and tuck the full transcript under a toggle header for reference.

## Step 4: Rinse and Repeat

Every time you find yourself doing a repeatable task, go through this process of recording a video, copying the transcript, and generating a checklist SOP. Over time, you'll build up a library of procedures that cover every aspect of your business operations.

And here's the kicker: once you've built up a critical mass of SOPs, you can use Notion's RAG (retrieval augmented generation) search function to query your knowledge base with natural language questions. Just type in something like "How do I edit a YouTube video in Descript?" and Notion will scan your SOPs and spit out the most relevant checklist.

This is a game-changer for onboarding new team members, delegating tasks, or just jogging your own memory when you need to do something you haven't done in a while. No more digging through old emails, Slack threads, or Google Docs - everything is organized and searchable in one place.

## The Beauty of the Low-Friction Approach

What I love about this system is its simplicity and portability. You're not relying on any fancy third-party tools or expensive subscriptions. Slack and Notion are tools that most businesses are already using, and the video recording and AI features are included in their base plans.

Plus, because you're storing all the data in Notion, you have complete ownership and control over your knowledge base. If Notion were to go under (god forbid), you could easily export your SOPs to another tool.

We're all about doing more with less. This low-friction approach to building a knowledge base is a perfect example of that ethos.

So the next time you find yourself doing something for the umpteenth time and thinking "there's got to be a better way," remember this simple process. Record, transcribe, generate, repeat. Before you know it, you'll have a repository of institutional knowledge that will save you time, streamline your operations, and set you up for sustainable growth.
