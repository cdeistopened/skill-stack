# Claude 3 Is Here: What Content Creators Need to Know

Another day, another chapter in AI drama. But while everyone's focused on OpenAI headlines, there's much bigger and more practical news: Anthropic just released Claude 3.

This is the story that deserves to be in the spotlight. Anyone interested in using AI to get their work done faster should be paying attention.

## Claude: A Model After a Content Creator's Heart

I've been bullish on Anthropic for a long time. Claude feels like an old friend. I've had thousands of conversations with it over the past year and developed a certain sympathy with it that is lacking in the other models. Almost everyone who uses it develops this sense that there's something different happening under the hood.

The biggest difference between Claude and ChatGPT used to be the larger context window (200k tokens), which allowed me to take long transcripts, book chapters, and even full books - my own source material - as the jumping-off point for transforming and refining content.

It has revolutionized the way I do my work. I keep waiting for others to catch up, but this has yet to happen.

With other models increasing their context windows, Anthropic needed to distinguish itself on other dimensions. After playing with Claude 3, it appears they've done it. They are ahead of the competition where it matters most: **efficient, quality content creation.**

## The Claude 3 Family

Claude 3 is not just one model; it's three models: Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku. Each offers a unique balance of capabilities, speed, and cost:

1. **Claude 3 Opus:** The most advanced and capable model, boasting near-human levels of comprehension and fluency on complex tasks. It excels at analysis, content creation, code generation, and nuanced conversations across multiple languages.

2. **Claude 3 Sonnet:** Offers a balance of capabilities and speed. It's more affordable and accessible to a broader range of users.

3. **Claude 3 Haiku:** The fastest and most cost-effective model, ideal for applications requiring quick responses and high throughput.

## The Growing Gap

Opus has demonstrated exceptional performance on various benchmark tests. In the "Needle in a Haystack" test, where a unique sentence about pizza toppings was hidden within a technical document, Claude 3 not only found the sentence but also recognized that it was out of place - even questioning if it was a joke or a test of its attention to detail.

This level of contextual awareness has some wondering if Claude is on the path to artificial general intelligence.

## Our Experiment: Writing from a Noisy Transcript

As content creators, we often find ourselves drowning in scattered ideas, notes, links, transcripts, and images. The challenge lies in organizing this raw material into a coherent and engaging final product. This is where Claude 3 shines.

We tested Claude 3 by using it to impose order on a messy podcast transcript - a casual conversation filled with tangents, side stories, and banter.

Here's our step-by-step process:

1. **Feed the transcript to Claude 3 Opus:** Provide the raw, unstructured transcript by copy-pasting or uploading a file.

2. **Use multi-step prompting to extract key ideas:** Ask Opus to identify main topics, themes, and actionable insights. The model parses through the noise and provides a clear, concise summary of the most important points.

3. **Generate a structured outline:** Prompt Opus to create an outline based on the key ideas it extracted. The model organizes information into a logical hierarchy with main sections, subsections, and bullet points.

4. **Refine the outline and draft the full article:** Ask Opus to refine the outline and draft the complete article, providing additional instructions on writing style, tone, and brand guidelines.

5. **Review and compare:** Review the generated article against the original transcript. The transformation was striking - Opus turned a rambling conversation into a polished piece of content.

## The Importance of Multi-Step Prompting

We thought we might get away with being lazy and generate the full article with just one prompt. The results were not impressive. But when we walked through the multi-step process, the results were a solid rough draft we could edit in 30 minutes, rather than the hours it would have taken from scratch.

This shows that even as technology advances, there's still no substitute for prompting skills and familiarity with AI.

## Writing is Thinking

Much of that thinking involves figuring out how pieces fit together. Claude 3 is undoubtedly capable of this type of thinking, in many ways better than a human. It reduces the cognitive load of organizing your ideas, helping you synthesize them in novel ways and make connections between disparate concepts.

By using the model to impose order on scattered ideas, we can focus more of our energy on the high-level creative work that matters.
