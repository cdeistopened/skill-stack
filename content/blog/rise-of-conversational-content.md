# The Rise of Conversational Content

Chris Dolinski first realized the power of getting under the hood with hands covered in engine grease. In the early days of founding Clutch.ca, the Canadian equivalent of Carvana, he and his brother were elbow-deep in a car engine, scrubbing away grime with toothbrushes to prep the vehicle for a photoshoot. This willingness to get his hands dirty and understand how things work at a fundamental level has driven Dolinski's 15-year career in building technology.

Now, as the founder of Vibehut.io, Dolinski aims to unlock the hidden value in the 3+ **trillion** hours of conversations on Zoom and other video conferencing tools each year. In an era where meaningful exchanges and idea generation often happen in unstructured, free-flowing conversations, Vibehut bridges the gap between teleconferencing software (like Zoom or Hangouts), recording software (like Riverside.fm), and course creator/community platforms (like YouTube, Skillshare, or Udemy).

## Reimagining Online Collaboration

Dolinski knew from the start that he wanted Vibehut to be different from dominant social media giants. Rather than creating another platform for mindless scrolling or fleeting viral fame, he aimed to facilitate genuine human connection and collaboration, helping people unlock the full potential of their conversations and ideas.

Vibehut integrates with existing social media accounts, eliminating the need for yet another login. It lets creators build communities for free, and only charges when they start monetizing their audience.

## Unlocking the Value of Conversation

We're most excited about the potential to unlock the full value of our conversations, turning them into a rich source of insights, ideas, and inspiration. Just as we only use a fraction of our brain's potential, we may only be using 10% of the value in our conversations, losing the rest to the digital memory hole.

Vibehut makes it easier than any other platform to repurpose call content - both clips and full-length videos, as well as transcripts. Features like instant upload to TikTok or YouTube and immediate access to call transcripts streamline the process of capturing and distributing valuable content from unstructured dialogue.

## A New Category of Digital Media

Our long-term ambition is to act as a midwife for a new category of digital media: conversational content. Vibehut offers a way to capture and amplify the value of these exchanges, turning them into a rich source of insights, inspiration, and creative raw material.

Just as platforms like YouTube and Instagram have given rise to new categories of creators and influencers, Vibehut has the potential to spawn a new generation of thought leaders and innovators who build their brands and businesses around the power of conversational content.
