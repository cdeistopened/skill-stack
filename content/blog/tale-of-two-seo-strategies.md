# A Tale of Two SEO Strategies

A marketing agency recently bragged about using AI to "steal" 3.6 million visits from a competitor by mass-producing copycat content from their sitemap.

Sounds genius. But is this really the future of SEO?

The "heist" itself was straightforward (if ethically challenged):

1. Scrape a competitor's content.
2. Have AI rewrite it en masse.
3. Steal their traffic.
4. Profit.

So, shouldn't we all be rushing to copy this strategy?

Not so fast. This strategy, though genius in a maniacal sort of way, is a dead end. Here's why.

## Google's SEO Rankings Are Getting Smarter

Their search algorithms are cracking down on low-quality, recycled content. The recent "helpful content" update and expansion of "E-A-T" criteria to "E-E-A-T" (adding "Experience") make churning out generic, boilerplate junk less effective. This update emphasizes content demonstrating first-hand experience, in addition to Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.

## SEO Is Not a Zero-Sum Game

Endlessly battling competitors for the same eyeballs leads nowhere. Your slice of a stagnant pie might grow, but the pie itself doesn't. It's worth asking how many of those 3.6 million visitors actually stuck around and converted. Generating a click is one thing - getting people to engage and take action is another. Without providing real value, most of that traffic likely bounced right back to search results.

## Good SEO Is About Providing Real Value

SEO isn't a game to be rigged or a code to crack. It's about making your unique expertise more discoverable to the people who need it most.

## Winning at SEO the Right Way

Look no further than Australian moving company Muval for inspiration.

Instead of tricks or hacks, their success stems from deep understanding of their customers and search intent at each stage of the buying journey.

They identified common routes people searched for pricing on, like "Sydney to Melbourne removalists." Then they created landing pages for each route displaying average job prices, space required, and more.

By answering prospects' questions, they establish authority while capturing highly relevant search traffic.

## Apply These Principles to Any Niche

A fitness coach could create landing pages comparing the pros and cons of different diets or exercise routines. A B2B SaaS company could build pages for each industry they serve, outlining specific use cases and benefits. The core principle remains the same: prioritize helpfulness.

## Align Content With Search Intent

The technical aspects of SEO, like keyword research and meta tags, are fairly straightforward. The real challenge lies in developing a deep understanding of your audience and crafting content that resonates.

Search intent falls into four main categories:

1. **Informational** - Looking for information
2. **Navigational** - Trying to reach a specific site
3. **Commercial** - Researching before a purchase
4. **Transactional** - Ready to buy now

The better you match your content type and format to the intent behind a query, the more relevant you'll be in Google's eyes.

## AI as SEO Force Multiplier

Once you have your keywords and search intent down, AI content creation tools can aid in executing an intent-focused content strategy at scale.

The key is starting from a place of genuine subject matter expertise. Use AI to streamline research, ideation, and creation - but always add your unique spin and quality control.

You might use AI to write multiple variations of meta descriptions and headlines optimized for different keywords. Or to take an existing piece and re-optimize it for a different searcher intent.

Just make sure you're always leading with substance, not churning out search-engine spam.

## Play the Long Game

Gaming the system through content mills will get harder and less effective over time. However, for businesses genuinely committed to providing value, this is good news.

**Less noise.** Less competition from those looking for a quick buck. More opportunities to stand out through quality.

Don't fall for supposed "cheat codes" that will become obsolete overnight.

**Play the long game.** Use AI as rocket fuel to scale your expertise. Focus relentlessly on being the best answer for your audience.

Get those fundamentals right, and no algorithm update can ever hurt you.
