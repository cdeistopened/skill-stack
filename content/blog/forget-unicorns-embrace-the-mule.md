# Forget Unicorns, Embrace the Mule

Silicon Valley has been conditioned to admire the unicorn - that rare and magical creature that achieves a billion-dollar valuation in record time. We celebrate the founders for their stratospheric visions, massive funding rounds, and unstoppable growth. But what if we've been chasing the wrong animal?

Enter the mule - the humble, hardworking, and surprisingly powerful creature that's been right under our noses all along. In the startup world, mules are the indie companies quietly building sustainable, profitable businesses without the hype or hubris of their unicorn counterparts. They're the media companies, the solopreneurs, and the scrappy teams of two or three using AI-powered tools, creativity, and grit to create products that serve a small niche of people desperate to buy.

Mules may not be as flashy as unicorns, but they have something more valuable: staying power. While unicorns burn through cash chasing growth at all costs, mules watch their expenses, prioritize profitability and high margins, and build loyal audiences around quality content.

With AI eating the world, it's the mules - not the unicorns - who are best positioned to thrive.

## Doing More with Less: The Power of Constraints

The power of the mule startup lies in its ability to do more with less. When you don't have the luxury of a massive funding round or huge team, you're forced to be resourceful, creative, and laser-focused on delivering value to customers. This is the essence of the "bootstrap mentality."

Take Pieter Levels, the solo founder behind Nomad List and Remote OK. With just a few thousand dollars and a whole lot of hustle, Levels built two profitable businesses serving a global community of remote workers. Or consider Transistor.fm, the podcasting platform that hit $1.7 million in revenue with just four employees.

These indie startups succeeded not in spite of their constraints, but because of them. When you're bootstrapping, you can't afford to waste time or money on vanity metrics. You have to focus on creating something people will pay for - then double down on what works.

As Bryce Roberts, founder of Indie.vc, writes in "The Indie Era of Startups," successful indie founders are "combining the growth of targeted venture funding with the durability found in bootstrapping."

## The Enduring Power of Content in an AI-Powered World

But wait - in a world where AI can generate endless streams of content at the touch of a button, how can a scrappy content solopreneur hope to compete? Won't the machines just drown out the humans?

Not so fast. As Dan Shipper argues in his Every.to article "Why Content is King," *quality* content cuts through the noise. Even in an AI-powered world, there are certain things only humans can create - emotional resonance, original insight, and authentic connection.

As Paul Wynn, group creative director at Prime Video and Amazon Studios, put it:

> "I find myself drawn to work where I can clearly see the human touch. Maybe it's a reaction to AI, but when you see the hand of the artist in every brushstroke and every wood shaving, it adds something."

In an age of algorithmic feeds and machine-generated content, people crave the authentic, the handmade, the deeply human.

## The Seven Powers of Content

How does media create power? What makes content such a formidable moat?

1. **Scale economies:** As a content business grows, it can invest more in higher-quality content, which attracts more audience and revenue. A virtuous cycle.

2. **Network effects:** Narratives can have network effects. The more people consume and talk about content, the more valuable it becomes as a cultural touchstone.

3. **Counter-positioning:** The ability to differentiate by taking a unique stance or serving an underserved niche.

4. **Switching costs:** Once readers have invested time and attention into a content brand, it's hard to switch to a competitor.

5. **Branding:** In a world of infinite content, a strong brand is a powerful signal of quality and trust.

6. **Cornered resources:** The unique talents and perspectives of the content creators themselves.

7. **Process power:** Proprietary processes for creating and distributing content that are hard for competitors to replicate.

Together, these seven powers form a moat that can protect a content business from technological disruption.

## AI as a Tool, Not a Threat

The promise of AI is not that it will replace human creators, but that it will enhance and augment their capabilities, allowing them to do more with less - which is the whole point of the mule startup.

With AI tools, solopreneurs and small teams can now prototype new ideas, test content formats, and generate quality copy (provided they seed it with good source material) in a fraction of the time.

But as any mule-shaped content creator knows, the key is to use these tools thoughtfully and strategically - not rely on them as a crutch. At the end of the day, it's the human element that sets winners apart: the ability to empathize with an audience, tell a compelling story, and make people feel something.

Or as Shipper puts it: "Ultimately, each new unit of content is a new unit of culture." And culture, for better or worse, is still a stubbornly human thing.

The indie content creators who thrive in the age of AI will be the ones who never lose sight of that fact.
