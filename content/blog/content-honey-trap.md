# The Content Honey Trap: A Framework for Podcast Promotion

Remember when audiograms were going to be the next big thing?

They were supposed to grab attention and drive listeners to your podcast. But they never worked. They were the epitome of "content for content's sake" - easy to create, but accomplishing nothing.

As Deirdre Tshien, co-founder & CEO of Capsho, reminded us, it's easy to get stuck in this trap - the loop of churning out episode after episode, without considering whether your efforts are moving the needle.

Audiograms are (mostly) gone, but they've been replaced by a new flood of cringe-worthy AI-generated social media posts. (If this is you, we can tell - no human uses the word "delve" that often.)

It *is* possible to write podcast descriptions and promotional posts that don't suck, but not if you're just word-vomiting the outputs from ChatGPT.

## The 4S Framework in Action

Tools like Capsho follow a version of what I call the "4S framework" for AI-assisted writing:

1. **Source**: Your podcast episode, which you upload to the platform, gives the relevant context so AI knows what you know.

2. **Substance**: The core premise you want to emphasize, which you select from options after uploading, so it doesn't go off the rails.

3. **Structure**: Here, Capsho uses an ingenious framework called the "honey trap" method to keep readers engaged.

4. **Style**: The persona and voice you want to emulate, programmed through a mix of instructions and examples.

This framework is a powerful tool for creating engaging, human-like content with AI assistance.

## The Content Honey Trap Explained

The Content Honey Trap - built in part on the 7 Hours Rule from Daniel Priestley's *Oversubscribed* - is designed to draw in listeners like a lovable stuffed bear to honey. Priestley says people need to spend about 7 hours with you or your content before they're ready to buy. Fortunately, those hours don't have to be consecutive.

Every positive interaction - be it a 30-minute podcast, a social media snippet, or deep dive newsletter - is a deposit in the trust bank. But most content creators get it wrong. They create and hope for the best, without considering how they're building trust or moving listeners towards a buying decision.

## How It Works in Practice

### The Content Event

At the heart is your main content event - typically a podcast episode or long-form video. This is where you deliver real value. But creating great content is only half the battle. First, you have to promote it.

### Push Content

Before you release your main content, create three strategic posts to build anticipation and identify your most engaged followers:

1. **The "Say Me" Post:** On Instagram, it's notoriously difficult to get users to click external links. The "Say Me" post helps isolate those who are most interested. For example: "Who's struggling with racing thoughts and wants to learn how to quiet their mind? Comment 'Me!' below!"

2. **The "Why" Post:** Explain why your upcoming content is important. Unpopular opinion posts work particularly well here. For example: "Unpopular opinion: Meditation isn't for everyone. In our upcoming workshop, we'll explore alternative methods for mastering your mind."

3. **The Social Proof Post:** Share a testimonial that demonstrates effectiveness. "Meet Sarah. Six months ago, she was overwhelmed by anxiety. Now, she's thriving. Learn the exact method she used in our upcoming workshop."

### The Bridge Funnel

After these push content posts, direct interested followers to your bridge funnel - a lead magnet, an event sign-up, or a direct link to your main content. Provide this link only to those who've expressed interest, focusing on the followers most likely to convert.

### The Main Event

Deliver the value you've been promising. The event itself can contain an upsell to your product or service, but you're only presenting this offer to people who've already expressed strong interest.

### Pull Content

What about those who missed your initial push? After your main event, create four more pieces of content:

1. **Awareness Post:** Pique curiosity. "Did you know that 95% of people have never learned how to properly manage their thoughts?"

2. **Tip Post:** Offer a valuable snippet. "Try this 2-minute mind reset technique from our recent workshop..."

3. **Community Post:** Give a behind-the-scenes peek. "Here's how I prepare my mind before each client session..."

4. **Action Post:** Directly promote with a strong call-to-action. "Ready to become the boss of your mind? Watch the replay here: [Link]"

## The Takeaway

The Content Honey Trap isn't about tricking people. It's about creating a path of value that naturally leads your most interested followers to your offers. Your followers get the help they need, and you build a sustainable business doing what you love.
