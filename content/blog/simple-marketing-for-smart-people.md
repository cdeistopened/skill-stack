# Simple Marketing for Smart People: An AI-Assisted Review

*Simple Marketing for Smart People* is vastly superior to its rival, Complex Marketing for Stupid People. It's a great afternoon read - short and to the point. But don't let its brevity fool you; this collaboration between Tiago Forte and Billy Broas packs a powerful punch.

As someone who's long followed Tiago Forte's work on building a second brain and the PARA method, I was intrigued to see him venture into marketing territory.

The real magic here comes from Billy Broas, the marketing guru behind Tiago's success. Their collaboration has produced a quick read with a message that cuts through the noise of typical marketing advice.

At its core, *Simple Marketing for Smart People* distinguishes between tactics, which are downstream, and core messaging, which is upstream. The book's central thesis? Marketing is education. It's not about countdown timers on landing pages, but rather changing beliefs.

## An AI-Assisted Experiment

To illustrate this principle in action, I set up an experiment with AI to apply Broas and Forte's framework to my own enterprise.

My goal was to refine core messaging, focusing on the upstream work of belief-changing that Broas and Forte emphasize as crucial to effective marketing. I leveraged the power of Claude to guide me through the exercises provided in the book's bonus materials.

I began by feeding Claude the key concepts and highlights from "Simple Marketing for Smart People," along with the messaging worksheet from the bonus material. I also provided some basic information about my business to give context.

With this foundation, I asked Claude to walk me through the framework, making inferences where needed and prompting me for additional information.

## Step 1: Identifying the Ideal Customer

Claude suggested:

> "Likely small business owners, solopreneurs, or content creators who handle content production themselves. They are aware of AI tools but may not fully understand how to integrate them effectively into their workflows."

This initial inference was surprisingly accurate, but I added:

> "The importance of bringing some kind of quality source material - however rough. It's not about generating from scratch, it's about transforming and automating the sequence of value-adding prompts and tools that accomplish this."

**Aha Moment #1:** Even with AI assistance, human insight is crucial. The AI can make logical inferences, but it can't read our minds or know every nuance of our business without explicit input.

## Step 2: Identifying Existing Beliefs

I prompted with some common misconceptions:

> "Most people have had the experience of using ChatGPT and having it give crappy output initially and so they just give up. The quality of the output will not be good enough to publish. There's a stigma around people who use AI - that they are scammy or lazy. Content is too generic."

Claude synthesized these into a structured list:

1. AI-generated content often requires multiple prompts and iterations to produce satisfactory output
2. The quality of AI-generated content is not good enough to publish without significant editing
3. There is a stigma associated with using AI for content creation
4. AI-generated content tends to be generic and lacks unique perspective

**Aha Moment #2:** The AI's ability to organize and structure scattered thoughts into a coherent list was invaluable.

## Step 3: Identifying Required Beliefs

I simply told Claude: "Okay, let's continue the exercise. You have everything you need to do this."

The AI provided a comprehensive breakdown of beliefs customers need at each stage of the buyer's journey (Awareness, Consideration, and Decision).

**Aha Moment #3:** The AI's ability to extrapolate and generate a logical progression of beliefs saved hours of brainstorming.

## Step 4: Crafting Core Messaging

Based on all previous steps, Claude crafted this core messaging statement:

> "We empower content creators and businesses to become 10x content engineers by combining the power of AI with their unique source material and human expertise. Our proven methodology and practical tools enable you to transform your content workflows and achieve unparalleled efficiency without sacrificing quality or authenticity."

**Aha Moment #4:** The AI synthesized all information into a cohesive message addressing both existing and desired beliefs.

## Step 5: Brainstorming Educational Content

Claude suggested several ideas, including:

- "The AI-Assisted Content Creation Playbook: How to Transform Your Workflows and Achieve 10x Efficiency"
- "The Source Material Advantage: How to Leverage Your Unique Content with AI for Maximum Impact"

**Aha Moment #5:** The AI not only generated content ideas but aligned them perfectly with our unique value proposition.

## The Bottom Line

Throughout this process, I was continually impressed by Claude's ability to understand context, make logical inferences, and provide structured, actionable outputs. However, I also recognized the crucial role of human input in guiding the AI and providing the nuanced understanding of our business that no AI can replicate.
