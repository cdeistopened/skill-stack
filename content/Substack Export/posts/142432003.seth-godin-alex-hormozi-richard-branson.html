<p>As entrepreneurs passionate about AI and creating high-quality content, we've always been on the lookout for ways to leverage technology to build successful lifestyle businesses. But when it came time to start our own joint venture, we found ourselves facing the same challenges that plague so many entrepreneurs: defining our brand values, identifying our ideal customer, and choosing the perfect name.</p><p>With our combined experience working with clients, we knew we had the skills and knowledge to fill this void. But we also knew that to succeed, we needed to lay a solid foundation for our joint brand.</p><p>We turned to ChatGPT for help, hoping to uncover groundbreaking insights to shape our brand strategy. But the responses we received were generic, vague, and all too familiar. We started to wonder:</p><p><strong>Is AI was really all it was cracked up to be when it came to branding and strategy?</strong></p><p>Enter the <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyNguyenPhD/status/1641793171423219713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1641793171423219713%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fmystrong%2F002-Alex-Hormozi-Richard-Branson-Seth-Godin-and-Kevin-Kelly-Walk-into-an-AI-Bar-b7efec27920348c1b4bed1e8f76d73ed%3Fpm%3Dc">"Wisdom Mentor Panel"</a> – an innovative AI-powered technique developed by Jeremy Nguyen that allows you to engage in a structured, five-step conversation with virtual versions of your preferred mentors<em>.</em> The key is its ability to draw out your own knowledge and assumptions, using the virtual mentors as a sounding board to challenge your thinking and offer fresh perspectives.

As we engaged in the five-step process, the mentors posed thought-provoking questions that forced us to articulate our core values and the emotional connection we hoped to create with our target audience.</p><p>For example, Seth Godin asked:</p><blockquote><p><em>"What's the story behind your brand? How do you want your audience to feel when they think about your brand?</em></p></blockquote><p>Similarly, Kevin Kelly prompted us to consider what unique aspect of our brand could turn a casual observer into a true fan, challenging us to identify our key differentiators.</p><p>Godin reminded us, "a brand is a set of expectations and relationships that cause a consumer to choose you," while Hormozi noted, "It's not just about the tools; it's about the transformation those tools enable."</p><p>Nothing too groundbreaking there.</p><p>The initial responses mostly mirrored our original input – a kind of "garbage in, garbage out" situation. But throughout the process, we found ourselves in a dynamic dialogue with the AI mentors, refining our thinking with each iteration. </p><p>But the true value of the "Wisdom Mentor Panel" lies in its ability to challenge your beliefs and offer alternative perspectives. We had to remind the AI of this crucial aspect, prompting the mentors to push us further:</p><ul><li><p><em>Godin raised concerns about the potential pitfalls of over-reliance on AI and questioned how to balance its use with maintaining originality and human creativity.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Branson expressed concerns about keeping the content and platform adaptable in a rapidly evolving AI landscape without losing simplicity and focus.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Hormozi highlighted the risk of missing out on early opportunities that may initially seem like fads.</em></p></li></ul><p>But the most thought-provoking insights came from Kevin Kelly, who questioned whether too much efficiency and time-saving might lead to a disconnection from the creative and business processes. He challenged us to consider how we could balance the efficiency offered by AI with the need for deep, hands-on engagement. This resonated with our own experiences of getting caught up in the excitement of creating automations and streamlining processes, only to find ourselves stuck in a rigid system that made iterations and adaptations difficult. </p><p>These questions served as a jumping-off point for our own conversation, sparking deeper insights and pushing us to refine our brand strategy.</p><h2>Key Takeaways and Insights:</h2><p>After completing our "Wisdom Mentor Panel" session, we walked away with several key insights:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Clarity on our core values:</strong> We realized our brand was about empowering entrepreneurs to harness AI to unlock their creativity, streamline their processes, and achieve their goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>A deeper understanding of our ideal customer:</strong> We developed a detailed profile of our target audience, including their demographics, psychographics, and key challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>A renewed focus on long-term value:</strong> The mentors challenged us to think beyond short-term trends and focus on creating lasting value for our customers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sparks of inspiration for a memorable brand name:</strong> While we didn't land on a final name during the session, the ideas generated by the mentors ignited our creativity and set us on the path to finding the perfect name.</p></li></ol><p>Admittedly, about 80% of the AI's responses were obvious, cliché, or boilerplate. But the remaining 20% helped us see what we previously hadn't and prompted us to update our assumptions.</p><p>If you're struggling to define your own brand identity, we recommend giving the "Wisdom Mentor Panel" a try. It's a powerful tool for sparking creativity, challenging assumptions, and uncovering the insights you need to build a brand that stands out.</p><p>In the end, our experience echoed the cliché from the movies: we had the answers within us all along; all we needed was a little help from our AI friends to bring them to light. The "Wisdom Mentor Panel" served as the catalyst, asking the right questions and pushing us to dig deeper, ultimately guiding us to the insights we needed to create a truly impactful brand.</p>
