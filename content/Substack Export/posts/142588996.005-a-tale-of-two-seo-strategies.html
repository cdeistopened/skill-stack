<p>A marketing agency recently bragged about using AI to "steal" 3.6 million visits from a competitor by mass-producing copycat content from their sitemap.</p><p>Sounds genius. But is this really the future of SEO?</p><p>The "heist" itself was straightforward (if ethically challenged):</p><ol><li><p>Scrape a competitor's content.</p></li><li><p>Have AI rewrite it en masse.</p></li><li><p>Steal their traffic. </p></li><li><p>Profit.</p></li></ol><p>So, shouldn’t we all be rushing to copy this strategy?</p><p>Not so fast. This strategy, though genius in a maniacal sort of way, is a dead end. Here’s why.</p><h4>Google's SEO rankings are getting smarter. </h4><p>Their search algorithms are cracking down on low-quality, recycled content. The recent "helpful content" update and expansion of "E-A-T" criteria to "E-E-A-T" (adding "Experience") make churning out generic, boilerplate junk less effective. This update emphasizes the importance of content demonstrating first-hand experience, in addition to Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness.</p><h4>SEO is not a zero-sum game. </h4><p>Endlessly battling competitors for the same eyeballs leads nowhere. Your slice of a stagnant pie might grow, but the pie itself doesn't. It's worth asking how many of those 3.6 million visitors actually stuck around and converted into customers. Generating a click is one thing - getting people to engage with your content and take a desired action is another. Without providing real value, most of that traffic likely bounced right back to the search results. You might win some battles, but the arc of the universe bends towards justice and your theft will be punished… eventually.</p><p>But Most importantly - it ignores what actually matters in SEO. </p><h4>Good SEO is about providing real value to your target audience.</h4><p>SEO isn't a game to be rigged or a code to crack. It's about making your unique expertise more discoverable to the people who need it most.</p><h2>Winning at SEO in 2023 and Beyond</h2><p>So how can you win at SEO the right way? Look no further than Australian moving company Muval for inspiration.</p><p>Instead of tricks or hacks, their success stems from a deep understanding of their customers and their search intent at each stage of the buying journey.</p><p>They identified common routes people searched for pricing on, like "Sydney to Melbourne removalists" (”removalist” is a made up Aussie word for a moving company – we had to Google that too). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

search traffic. </p><p>The principles of Muval's SEO strategy can be applied across niches. </p><p>For example, a fitness coach could create landing pages comparing the pros and cons of different diets or exercise routines. A B2B SaaS company could build pages for each industry they serve, outlining specific use cases and benefits. The possibilities are endless - but the core principle remains the same: prioritize helpfulness.</p><p>The key is to put yourself in your target audience's shoes and anticipate what they're searching for at each stage of their journey. By creating content that directly addresses those needs and questions, you can establish yourself as an authoritative resource.</p><h1>Align Content With Search Intent</h1><p>There's nothing about SEO that you can't learn in half a day. The technical aspects, like keyword research and meta tags, are fairly straightforward. The real challenge lies in developing a deep understanding of your audience and crafting content that resonates.</p><p>If there's a niche lacking sufficient content for an audience interested in that topic within the SEO domain, developing a website with a template that provides highly valuable, specific information to assist them is a logical next step. It leads to the production of content that meets this demand.</p><p>In other words, the sweet spot for SEO is finding those under-served niches where you can fill a genuine content gap. That's where you can make the greatest impact and gain traction most quickly.</p><p>Search intent falls into four main categories:</p><ol><li><p>Informational - Looking for information</p></li><li><p>Navigational - Trying to reach a specific site</p></li><li><p>Commercial - Researching before a purchase</p></li><li><p>Transactional - Ready to buy now</p></li></ol><p>The better you can match your content type and format to the intent behind a query, the more relevant you'll be in Google's eyes.</p><p>So for informational searches, in-depth guides and how-to content reign supreme. For commercial searches, reviews and comparisons fit the bill. You get the idea.</p><p>The better you can match your content type and format to the intent behind a query, the more relevant you'll be in Google's eyes.</p><p>So for informational searches, in-depth guides and how-to content reign supreme. For commercial searches, reviews and comparisons fit the bill. Tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush can help you uncover the universe of related keywords to guide your content planning. You get the idea.</p><h2>AI as SEO Force Multiplier</h2><p>Once you have your keywords and search intent down, AI content creation tools can be an aid in executing an intent-focused content strategy at scale.</p><p>The key is to start from a place of genuine subject matter expertise. Use AI to streamline research, ideation, and creation - but always add your unique spin and quality control.</p><p>You might use AI to write multiple variations of meta descriptions and headlines optimized for different keywords. Or to take an existing piece and re-optimize it for a different searcher intent.</p><p>The possibilities are endless for making your expertise more accessible. Just make sure you're always leading with substance, not churning out search-engine spam.</p><p>Another outdated tactic to avoid is using PBNs (Private Blog Networks) - groups of websites owned by the same entity existing purely to funnel link authority to a "money site." While this may have worked in the past, Google now easily sniffs out and penalizes such schemes.</p><p>Gaming the system through techniques like keyword stuffing, content mills and PBNs will get harder and less effective over time.</p><p>As Google continues to refine its ability to separate wheat from chaff, the bar for SEO success will only rise.</p><p>Gaming the system through content mills and PBNs will get harder and less effective over time.</p><p>However, for businesses genuinely committed to providing value, this is good news.</p><p><strong>Less noise.</strong> Less competition from those looking for a quick buck. More opportunities to stand out through quality.</p><p>So don't fall for supposed "cheat codes" that will become obsolete overnight.</p><p><strong>Play the long game.</strong> Use AI as rocket fuel to scale your expertise. Focus relentlessly on being the best answer for your audience.</p><p>Get those fundamentals right, and no algorithm update can ever hurt you.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://contentvikings.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Create more compelling content – with confidence – in less time, using AI, automation, and no-code tools.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p></p><h1>Show Notes:</h1><p>In this episode, we dive into the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered SEO. We examine the controversial "AI SEO heist" where a marketer used AI to mass-produce content from a competitor's site. While it generated buzz, we argue this strategy is shortsighted and unsustainable in the long run. Google's algorithms are getting smarter at identifying and penalizing low-quality, recycled content, as evidenced by recent "helpful content" and "E-E-A-T" updates. Instead, the path to SEO success lies in providing genuine value to your target audience, as exemplified by Australian moving company Muval. By creating landing pages that directly answer prospects' key questions, they've established authority and captured relevant traffic. We discuss how to align your content with search intent, leveraging AI as a force multiplier for your SEO efforts.
