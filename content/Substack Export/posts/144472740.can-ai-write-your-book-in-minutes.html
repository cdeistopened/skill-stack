<p>Betteridge’s Law of Headlines suggests that any headline ending in a question mark can be answered with a resounding “no.” So, when you ask, “Can AI write your book in minutes?” we're here to confirm that the law holds true—especially when it comes to tools like <a href="https://designrr.io/">Designrr.io</a>.</p><p>If you're looking for a magic wand to generate quality content with AI, Designrr ain't it. We were lured by the slick YouTube ad and impressive-sounding user stats, but what lurks beneath the surface is a content creation tool that's mediocre at best and embarrassingly bad at worst.</p><p>One of us (Charlie) took Designrr for a spin on a 7-day trial, wondering if it could possibly deliver on the promise of repurposing any kind of input content (like blog posts and podcasts) into any kind of output (like lead magnets and ebooks). The user interface was fairly intuitive, allowing you to import content from various sources - blogs, Word docs, PDFs, even video and audio files. So far so good, right?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRoU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRoU!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRoU!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRoU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRoU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png" width="1151" height="574" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:574,&quot;width&quot;:1151,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:145300,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRoU!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRoU!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRoU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRoU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faee00e66-ae53-4d08-98b4-473de01dcee1_1151x574.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>However, the output generated by Designrr was pure, unadulterated <em>pablum</em>. When attempting to create a short book on AI for content creation, the tool barfed out an 8-chapter abomination filled with inane, generic advice that barely skimmed the surface of the topic. The writing was so vague and devoid of substance, it made Kamala Harris sound like Ernest Hemingway.</p><p>But it gets worse. The "book" came complete with an auto-generated cover that looked like a ransom note composed by a preschooler. The interior formatting wasn't much better - just page after page of drivel with no discernible structure or narrative flow.</p><p>The “transformation” tool wasn’t any better. It allowed you to import content from a blog, which was then haphazardly formatted into a cheap lead magnet template with janky formatting. No transformation of the underlying words, just a bulk copy-paste operation that left numerous errors and artifacts from the import process.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://contentvikings.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://contentvikings.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Here's the thing - we have found that with the right guidance AI can be an  powerful tool for refining, transforming, and enhancing your own ideas. But tools like Designrr represent the worst possible use case: relying on AI to generate entire compositions from scratch with minimal human input or direction. The result is exactly what you'd expect - a steaming pile of word salad.</p><p>Don’t be fooled by the flashy promises from tools like Designrr. Focus on using AI as a collaborative tool to <em>support</em> your creative process, not a machine that replaces it entirely. Start with your own ideas, experiences, and unique point of view, then leverage AI's power to help you transform that raw material into something truly valuable for your audience. </p><p>The future of AI-powered content creation is bright, but tools like Designrr are a dead end. As always, the key is to stay human, stay real, and use technology to amplify your voice, not drown it out in a sea of generic, soulless dreck. Trust us on this one.</p>
