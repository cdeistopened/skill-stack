<p>Back in 2017, a team of animators at Studio Ghibli excitedly presented an AI-generated animation to their boss –&nbsp;legendary filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki. </p><p>He was less than impressed.</p><p>"I am utterly disgusted," Miyazaki said, his face stern. "If you want to make something creepy, go ahead. I never wish to incorporate this technology into my work. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself."</p><p>The young animators looked crestfallen.</p><div id="youtube2-ngZ0K3lWKRc" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ngZ0K3lWKRc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ngZ0K3lWKRc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>"We humans are losing faith in ourselves," Miyazaki added.</p><p>When grilled by another senior executive about their goal, one young animator piped up:</p><blockquote><p><strong>"Well, we would like to build a machine that can draw pictures like humans do."</strong></p></blockquote><p>Miyazaki's response was grim. "I feel like we are nearing the end of times."</p><p>Today, we are 7 years closer to the end of times. OpenAI’s “Sora” video generation model not only can draw pictures like humans do, but much more.</p><p>Meanwhile, the head of the booming AI chip maker NVIDIA says that humans need not learn to program anymore, since computers will increasingly do it for us. </p><p><strong>First, let’s be clear about what Miyazaki gets right:</strong> </p><p>AI is no replacement for human creativity. </p><p>However, we can still recognize it as a powerful <em>lever</em> for aiding and enhancing human creativity and efficiency.</p><p>Especially when it comes to functional “jobs to be done,” AI can act as a powerful tool, <em>amplifying</em> human creativity and efficiency. This is especially clear in the realm of programming and computers, where software amplifies our cognitive faculties. </p><p>While I’m sure there are certain programmers who look at their work as a kind of art form, few are crying over the prospect of programming jobs going away. It’s the fear of human creativity and values being stripped out of the process by cheap, mass-produced AI-driven content.</p><p>Miyazaki's revulsion to AI in artistic processes raises an important question: What is the role of AI in the process of creating what now goes by the ubiquitous name of <strong>Content™</strong>? </p><p>People talk about digital content like a homogenous blob. Pre-internet, it was more clear that content served specific purposes. Films, newsletters, books, music, and even how-to manuals, SOPs, and other functional documents have always been created to serve a particular function: <strong>to do a job.</strong></p><p><strong>The end goal and the job to be done matter.</strong> </p><p>There are many purposes for content –&nbsp;from emotional, to financial, to functional. The common denominator is the satisfaction of a human need or desire. This has become less clear in the year 2024, when certain forms of content seem to exist for their own sake. People are looking to monetize eyeballs and attention without regard for the underlying value, as if to fill a void in our insatiable desire to consume.</p><p>We can’t argue with Miyazaki about what makes an artistic masterpiece, but we can lay out a definitive criteria for the value of AI in these latter days.</p><p>Asimov had his three laws for robots; we just have this one.</p><p><strong>If an AI-generated work resonates with its intended audience and fulfills their needs, it has accomplished its purpose. </strong></p><p>It's similar to how we perceive the value of currency. If a group of people agree that something has value, whether abstract or tangible, then it is deemed valuable.</p><p>To some, this criteria may sound too value neutral. By this definition, wouldn’t the endless streams of AI-driven clickbait count as valuable? </p><p>But the answer is no. They might provide value to the creator in the form of ad revenue, traffic, etc., but if it’s not helping to get a job done, it violates our criteria.</p><p>The fallacy behind the common fears of the Great AI Replacement is thinking that AI is like a magic wand that can wave away the need for human input. </p><blockquote><p><strong>“a machine that can draw pictures like humans do."</strong></p></blockquote><p>The truth is, it's a tool that requires careful guidance and context to produce meaningful results. </p><p>Sora’s 8-second video clips are impressive. But the real value will come from the way that animators and storytellers string together AI prompts in ways that captivate our attention and deliver inner meaning to match their shiny exterior.</p><p>In the realm of AI-assisted writing, the creator must seed AI with relevant context and source material. The quality of the output depends heavily on the quality of the input. </p><p><strong>Garbage in, garbage out.</strong> </p><p><strong>Treasure in, treasure out.</strong></p><p>That's why we put transcripts at the heart of our workflow. Our conversations lay out the context and ideas that inform the AI's outputs, ensuring that the results are relevant, useful, and aligned with our audience’s goals. By providing clear instructions, carefully crafted prompts, and regular feedback, we can steer AI towards producing better, more relevant results.</p><p>Particularly when it comes to functional writing and content creation – Jobs to Be Done – AI can act as a powerful lever, amplifying human creativity and efficiency. We’ve experienced this firsthand in my work with clients, turning podcasts into show notes, summaries, and even articles, newsletters, and books written in the voice of the host. What used to take us three to four hours for a podcast, we can now do in 30 minutes, with maybe 15-20 more minutes of polishing.</p><p>The key is to view AI not as the machine itself, but as a tool used in conjunction with the machine. It's not about replacing human creativity but rather unlocking bandwidth for higher-level tasks. When I engage in this AI-assisted workflow, I experience a flow state. I'm still fully engaged, thinking about how to structure my prompts and approach the task at a higher level than before. The time I save on mundane tasks frees me to focus on the more creative aspects of the work.</p><p>There are still plenty of mundane parts of our job that we look forward to having replaced by AI. With less time spent on the mechanics of content creation, we can spend more time thinking about our audience’s real needs and the jobs they need to get done.</p><p>Listen to the full episode to see how we generate blog posts and show notes out of our podcasts (including this one!).</p><h2>Show Notes:</h2><p>This inaugural episode was recorded after the completion of the first season, distilling our key thesis about AI’s practical uses in content creation, focusing on its potential as a tool rather than a replacement for human creativity. We discuss Hayao Miyazaki's criticism of AI art, our experiences using AI to repurpose content, and the importance of human input in guiding AI. We also compare AI tools for repurposing podcast content with our own customized solution.</p><h3>Links:</h3><ul><li><p>Nvidia CEO predicts the death of coding: <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/nvidia-ceo-predicts-the-death-of-coding-jensen-huang-says-ai-will-do-the-work-so-kids-dont-need-to-learn">https://www.techradar.com/pro/nvidia-ceo-predicts-the-death-of-coding-jensen-huang-says-ai-will-do-the-work-so-kids-dont-need-to-learn</a></p></li></ul><h3>Tools:</h3><ul><li><p>Capsho: https://www.capsho.com/</p></li><li><p>Anthropic Claude:&nbsp;https://www.anthropic.com/</p></li><li><p>Make:&nbsp;https://www.make.com/</p></li><li><p>Notion:&nbsp;https://www.notion.so/</p></li><li><p>Zapier:&nbsp;https://www.zapier.com/</p></li></ul><h3>Tl;dr:</h3><p>00:00 - Introduction: AI and human creativity</p><p>01:54 - Hayao Miyazaki's criticism of AI-generated art</p><p>04:56 - AI as a lever for efficiency and creativity in functional tasks</p><p>06:03 - Personal experiences using AI for content repurposing</p><p>11:11 - Viewing AI as a tool used in conjunction with human input</p><p>15:13 - Comparing AI-powered tools like Capsho with custom "micro-SaaS" solutions</p><p>22:44 - The importance of human judgment and context in guiding AI</p><p>24:47 - New criteria for evaluating AI-generated work</p><p>26:34 - Building your own AI-assisted content repurposing workflow</p><p>41:08 - Demonstration of a custom AI-assisted workflow using Notion and Claude</p><p>56:30 - Conclusion</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> AI creativity, AI-generated art, Hayao Miyazaki, content repurposing, AI tools, micro-SaaS, Notion, Zapier, Claude, AI workflow, human input, AI masterpieces, content creation, jobs to be done, AI efficiency</p>
