<p>As vikings, we are particular about our tools.</p><p>Catapults… axes… helmets… you can’t go into battle with the wrong weapons.</p><p>Similarly, modern content creation depends on the right software and hardware.</p><p>Neither quantity nor quality alone is enough. </p><p>You need both. </p><p>Leveling up your production values won't automatically gain you new fans, but <em><strong>failing</strong></em> to meet a basic quality threshold <em><strong>will</strong></em> lose you viewers/listeners. You don't want your show to become another amateur effort collecting dust in the graveyard of half-baked podcasts.</p><p>The problem has traditionally been professional looking and sounding podcasts take longer to produce, or a big budget and paid subcontractors to do your grunt work. Now, there are dozens (hundreds?) of shiny new AI tools promising to help content creators streamline their workflows and boost production value. But this gives rise to a new kind of analysis paralysis. In our experience, most of these tools are overly specific and just add complexity—like duct-taping another gear onto an already overcomplicated Rube Goldberg machine.</p><p>The good news is you can create a professional-grade podcast or YouTube video, complete with polished assets like thumbnails, show notes, and social clips, using just 6 tools (and you probably already have #5 of them in your pocket).</p><p>These tools aren’t magic. They won’t generate compelling content for you. You still need to come up with quality ideas and have interesting conversations with guests. But they WILL allow you to package that content in an attractive, listener-friendly way, without wasting hours on busywork.</p><p>The “N.O.R.D.I.C.” podcasting stack is our Viking-approved suite of tools to become a “full stack” content creator –&nbsp;covering everything from recording and editing to graphics and distribution.</p><p>Some of these tools involve a small learning curve, but once you master them, you’ll be able to ship a lot more content, of higher quality, in a lot less time.</p><p>Remember our motto: <strong>Finish your work and go outside.</strong></p><h2>Notion: Your Podcast’s Second Brain and CRM</h2><p>Still relying on scattered Google Docs and haphazard notes apps to manage your podcast? Time to sharpen your axe. <a href="http://notion.so">Notion</a> is an all-in-one workspace that acts as a "second brain," allowing you to organize your ideas, content calendars, transcripts, and workflows in one intuitive platform.</p><p>Think of Notion as your podcast's mission control center. You can use it to:</p><ul><li><p>Capture and categorize episode/guest ideas as they strike.</p></li><li><p>Create dedicated pages for each guest, episode, complete with outlines, research notes, and key discussion points</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with guests and co-hosts, sharing resources and tracking progress leading up to recording sessions</p></li></ul><p>We use a master database for our recording calendar that functions as a CRM –&nbsp;showing us our list of prospective guests, the topics we want to discuss with them, and progress towards publishing the episode once they agree to join.</p><h2>Opus: Claude 3 Pro</h2><p><a href="http://claude.ai">Claude’s</a> most powerful LLM, Opus, has taken AI assisted writing to a new level. It’s scary good at reading a podcast and helping you brainstorm everything from your show notes, to titles, to ideas for blog posts based on a meandering hour-long conversation.</p><p>While not a replacement for human creativity, Opus is a powerful ally. Of all the LLMS, it’s the most conversational and the best at writing.</p><p>Opus is the most powerful LLM model. It can read and understand the contents of your podcast episode better than you at times, and make connections between ideas or conversation points.</p><p>I might start by having it pull out some of the best quotes that I might use as short reels/shorts.</p><p>Opus can also identify areas in the conversation that need to be edited out like technical glitches, or meandering asides.</p><p>I use Opus to write full length articles using transcripts and the articles they discuss as the source material.</p><p>I iterate with it in the conversational chat bot interface until I seize on the right big picture idea, then proceed to build out an outline. Finally, I ask for its help to draft the article from the outline.</p><h2><strong>R</strong> is for <a href="http://Riverside.fm">Riverside.fm</a></h2><p><a href="http://riverside.fm/">Riverside.fm</a> is the best in class recording tool to get high-quality audio and video from your guest, for a more professional look than Zoom, which depends on all parties having a strong internet connection. Riverside records all parties’ files directly at the source and then uploads them from the harddisk to the cloud immediately after the recording is finished.</p><div

full episode, or export short clips directly for YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, etc.</p><h2><strong>D is for Descript</strong></h2><p>For editing the full episode, <a href="https://twitter.com/DescriptApp">Descript</a> has done something amazing. They have put the fun back into audio and video editing. Descript lets you edit text to edit the underlying audio, create and apply templates for intros/outros, captions, and visual effects, and much more. They have a large library of royalty and license-free music and sound effects, so you don't run afoul of YouTube's stringent copyright penalties.</p><p>Of all the tools, Descript has the steepest learning curve, but it is designed with the user in mind, and you can figure out the basic features in the course of an afternoon.</p><p>Some other features:</p><ul><li><p>"Studio sound" filter that turns audio from a decent mic into pro-sounding audio.</p></li><li><p>Truncate silences over a certain length</p></li><li><p>Highlight and delete filler words</p></li><li><p>Active speaker view - automatically cut to a full-screen view of the track featuring the person talking.</p></li><li><p>Rapid export to web (so you can preview it and share it without downloading a clunky file and then re-uploading to GDrive)</p></li></ul><p>I can't live without their Creator plan, and they have easily earned my $12/month.</p><h2><strong>I is for your iPhone</strong></h2><p>You can go down endless rabbit holes about the best webcam and become convinced you need a DSLR costing thousands of dollars. But chances are, the best camera within your budget is already sitting in your pocket.</p><p>We often forget when we purchase an expensive webcam that we are carrying around a $1,000 state-of-the-art 1080p webcam/microphone powerhouse in your pocket.</p><p>It performs well in mediocre light, and even the microphone is good enough for most purposes.</p><p>I used to use a program called Camo Studio to connect my iPhone as a camera, but the latest OS comes with a native feature called Continuity Camera that lets you connect your phone as a webcam wherever both the computer and phone can connect to the same Wifi.</p><h2><strong>C is for Canva</strong></h2><p>I've been a pro subscriber to <a href="http://canva.com">Canva</a> for about 5 years, and I've never gone back to Photoshop since.</p><p>The background remover filter alone is worth the price of admission.</p><p>They have templates for any conceivable kind of content. YouTube thumbnails, etc.</p><p>While it was built as a graphic design suite, it doubles as a social media scheduler. </p><p>Most posts are improved by a simple graphic, and you don't have to reinvent the wheel if you use Canva.</p><div><hr></div><p>As the Vikings used to say, "A wise warrior chooses his tools carefully, for a battle won with the wrong weapons is still a loss.”</p><p>Also, don't forget to pillage responsibly and always wear a helmet, because a concussed Viking is no use to anyone, especially when it comes to podcasting.</p><p>In short, take the time to learn a few tools well. Don't go chasing after the latest shiny object — even if it has "AI" appended to it. Use them. Don't let them use you.</p>
