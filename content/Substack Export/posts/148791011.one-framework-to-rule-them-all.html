<p>The Content Vikings have been at sea for a long time.</p><p>But we haven't forgotten our homeland, nor our mission, and we're not adrift. Instead we've been in work mode – building content systems using the latest and greatest tools and techniques – putting AI to work in service of bold, human ideals.</p><p>A few months ago, I had an epiphany about the contours of a prompting method that would gradually morph into what I call the 4S framework. </p><p>My wife teases me about it. Like “fetch” in Mean Girls, she tells me I should stop trying to make “4S” happen.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GOEF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GOEF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GOEF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GOEF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GOEF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif" width="424" height="424" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:220,&quot;width&quot;:220,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:424,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Fetch Is Never Going To Happen GIFs | Tenor&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Fetch Is Never Going To Happen GIFs | Tenor" title="Fetch Is Never Going To Happen GIFs | Tenor" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GOEF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GOEF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GOEF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GOEF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2257fe9-d8c6-4cd7-8db1-bea7a6b13965_220x220.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But I insist that it’s genius, and it’s going to happen. </p><p>4S is an overarching framework that subsumes other frameworks that are perhaps more elegant or established like P-A-S (problem agitate solution) and A-I-D-A (attention, interest, desire, action) into an easy-to-use process for writing anything <em>with </em>AI (plus your own ideas).</p><p>If you've ever tried writing something with AI, chances are you were disappointed with the results. Or at least, didn't think they were good enough to share with the world, your boss, or whoever.</p><p>Maybe the voice was off. Maybe it hallucinated (read: made up) important details. You figured it would take more time to edit than to just write yourself. It didn't feel right. </p><p>This is because it wasn't you. It did what you asked but not what you wanted. It didn't follow your thought process. It didn't understand what was important or unique. And it used words like "delve" and "unleash" in the most cringeworthy ways.</p><p>One of the missing pieces was a framework.</p><p>What is a framework? It’s a structure that is solid enough to support your creativity, but open-ended enough to give expression to the ideas that are uniquely yours.</p><p>As a content marketer, I have a bad habit of collecting frameworks that I rarely use. I’ve amassed a library of best practices, templates, and essential elements for everything from landing pages, to welcome sequences, book chapters, opening hooks, headlines, X threads, Threads threads, and every imaginable kind of social media post. </p><p>My first ‘a-ha’ moment about Large Language Models was how adept they are at polishing rough, low fidelity “source material.”</p><p>My second epiphany was how much better they are at the above task when you <em>also </em>provide them just a bit more structure and information about your objectives. </p><p>Enter the 4S framework (yes, we’re really going to make this happen).</p><p>The basic framework is deceptively simple. There are 4 elements of effective AI-assisted writing, and they all start with s (if you squint):</p><ul><li><p>Source: Your raw material, the treasure trove of your ideas</p></li><li><p>Substance: The core message, your "big idea worth sharing"</p></li><li><p>Structure: The framework that fits your content and guides your reader</p></li><li><p>Style: Your unique voice that makes the content unmistakably yours</p></li></ul><p>We've written at length about the importance of good source material (see <a href="https://contentvikings.substack.com/p/can-ai-write-your-book-in-minutes">here</a>, <a href="https://contentvikings.substack.com/p/005-a-tale-of-two-seo-strategies">here</a>, and <a href="https://contentvikings.substack.com/p/004-transform-dont-generate">here</a>, for example).

I used to polish these manually, but now AI does it in 1/10 the time, producing higher quality results. When I first used Notion's "improve writing" tool on an AI-generated transcript, the result seemed like sorcery. </p><p>Now, I call it <strong>sourcery</strong>: transforming base inputs into gold.</p><p>But the real alchemical transformation comes when you enlist AI to first help you distill a body of content into its diverse elements. This is where <em>substance</em> comes into play. AI helps reorganize those elements around the core ideas, the "big idea worth sharing." </p><p><em>Structure –&nbsp;</em>your chosen framework – is the skeleton that holds it all together. Whether it's a Standard Operating Procedure (one of my all-time favorite frameworks) or a compelling narrative arc, the right structure guides both the AI and your reader through your ideas. This is where the 4S framework becomes the “One Ring to Rule Them All,” but instead of rings of power, we’re talking hard-hitting frameworks. Different frameworks get different jobs done, and some are more appropriate for certain kinds of source material and substance. But if you don’t specify <em>any </em>structure, ChatGPT (and even my beloved Claude) will default to the lowest common denominator framework&nbsp;–&nbsp;the kind of essay structure your middle school teacher tried to get you to follow, with a beginning, a middle and an end. Yawn.</p><p><em>Style, </em>then, would seem to be the cherry on top. Sometimes, style is secondary (as in the case of a Standard Operating Procedure), but don’t underestimate its importance. As Strunk and White taught us, good style is about conveying meaning clearly without too many words. But it also serves other purposes, like capturing attention, holding it, earning your readers trust, and ultimately, changing their mind.</p><p>So you really can’t overlook any of the 4 S’s if you plan to write with AI, at least not if you want to stand out in the endless sea of content that is produced every day.</p><p>The framework is simple, and the applications are almost endless. It is enhanced and supplemented by every other framework you encounter.</p><p>As the title of this new section of our Substack implies, we will be exploring the myriad use-cases for the 4S framework in conjunction with some of the most useful structures and complementary frameworks that can be plugged into it. Welcome to the Framework Files. </p><p>I'm not saying 4S is the end-all-be-all. Perhaps there's a 5th 'S' out there waiting to be discovered. But for now, I'm sticking with 4S – and I'm inviting you to join me on this exploration.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://contentvikings.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Join 500+ friends getting a fresh framework dissected and applied to your inbox every Friday.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>Let's make 4S happen together.</p>
