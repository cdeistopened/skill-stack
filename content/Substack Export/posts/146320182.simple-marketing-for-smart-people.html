<p><em>Simple Marketing for Smart People</em> is vastly superior to its rival, Complex Marketing for Stupid People. It's a great afternoon read - short and to the point. But don't let its brevity fool you; this collaboration between Tiago Forte and Billy Broas packs a powerful punch.</p><p>As someone who's long followed Tiago Forte's work on building a second brain and the PARA method, I was intrigued to see him venture into marketing territory. Though I must admit, his recent forays into ayahuasca and polyamory have me wondering if he's determined to tank his brand. (Don't do it, Tiago!)</p><p>But I digress. The real magic here comes from Billy Broas, the marketing guru behind Tiago's success. Their collaboration has produced a quick read with a message that cuts through the noise of typical marketing advice.</p><p>At its core, <em>Simple Marketing for Smart People</em> distinguishes between tactics, which are downstream, and core messaging, which is upstream. The book's central thesis? Marketing is education. It's not about countdown timers on landing pages, but rather changing beliefs.</p><p>To illustrate this principle in action, we set up an experiment with AI to apply  Broas and Forte’s framework to our own enterprise, Content Vikings. </p><p>We'll walk through the framework provided in the book, using AI to assist us in honing our core message.</p><p>Certainly! I'll rewrite the section starting from "Here's how we set this up" with more focus on the AI-assisted process and the steps we followed based on the transcript.</p><p>Understood. I'll revise the setup to be more concise and focus on the initial process, reserving the details for the results section. Here's a revised version:</p><h3>Here's how we set this up:</h3><p>Our goal was to refine Content Vikings' core messaging, focusing on the upstream work of belief-changing that Broas and Forte emphasize as crucial to effective marketing. To do this, we leveraged the power of AI, specifically Claude, to guide us through the exercises provided in the book's bonus materials.</p><p>We began by feeding Claude the key concepts and highlights from "Simple Marketing for Smart People," along with the messaging worksheet from the bonus material. We also provided some basic information about Content Vikings to give context.</p><p>With this foundation, we asked Claude to walk us through the framework, making inferences where needed and prompting us for additional information. </p><p>As we worked through the process, we had several "aha" moments that highlighted the power of this approach. Let's dive into the results of our AI-assisted messaging exercise and explore these insights along the way.Step 1: Identifying the Ideal Customer</p><p>We started by asking Claude to infer our target customer profile based on the information we had provided about Content Vikings. The AI suggested:</p><p>"Likely small business owners, solopreneurs, or content creators who handle content production themselves. They are aware of AI tools but may not fully understand how to integrate them effectively into their workflows."</p><p>This initial inference was surprisingly accurate, but we realized it lacked a crucial element of our value proposition. We added:</p><p>"A couple things to add: the importance of bringing some kind of quality source material - however rough. It's not about generating from scratch, it's about transforming and automating the sequence of value-adding prompts and tools that accomplish this."</p><p>Aha Moment #1: Even with AI assistance, human insight is crucial. The AI can make logical inferences, but it can't read our minds or know every nuance of our business without explicit input.</p><p>Step 2: Identifying Existing Beliefs</p><p>Next, we asked Claude to help us brainstorm our customers' existing beliefs about AI and content creation. We prompted with some common misconceptions:</p><p>"Most people have had the experience of using ChatGPT and having it give crappy output initially and so they just give up. The quality of the output will not be good enough to publish. There's a stigma around people who use AI - that they are scammy or lazy. Content is too generic."</p><p>Claude then synthesized these points into a structured list of existing beliefs:</p><ol><li><p>AI-generated content often requires multiple prompts and iterations to produce satisfactory output, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.</p></li><li><p>The quality of AI-generated content is not good enough to publish without significant editing and human intervention.</p></li><li><p>There is a stigma associated with using AI for content creation, with perceptions that it is a lazy or scammy approach.</p></li><li><p>AI-generated content tends to be generic and lacks the unique perspective and voice that audiences value.</p></li></ol><p>Aha Moment #2: The AI's ability to organize and structure our scattered thoughts into a coherent list was invaluable. It helped us see the patterns in our customers' beliefs more clearly.</p><p>Step 3: Identifying Required Beliefs</p><p>For this crucial step, we simply told Claude: "Okay, let's continue the exercise. You have everything you need to do this."</p><p>The AI then provided a comprehensive breakdown of the beliefs our customers need to have at each stage of the buyer's journey (Awareness, Consideration, and Decision). For example, in the Awareness stage:</p><p>"They need to believe that inefficient content creation is a significant problem that hinders their productivity and ability to compete in their market."</p><p>Aha Moment #3: The AI's ability to extrapolate from the information we had provided and generate a logical progression of beliefs was impressive. It saved us hours of brainstorming and organizing our thoughts.</p><p>Step 4: Crafting Core Messaging</p><p>Based on all the previous steps, Claude then crafted a core messaging statement for Content Vikings. Here's an excerpt:</p><p>"Content Vikings empowers content creators and businesses to become 10x content engineers by combining the power of AI with their unique source material and human expertise. Our proven methodology and practical tools enable you to transform your content workflows and achieve unparalleled efficiency without sacrificing quality or authenticity."</p><p>Aha Moment #4: The AI was able to synthesize all the information we had provided into a cohesive message that addressed both existing beliefs and desired beliefs. It was a powerful demonstration of how AI can assist in the creative process of messaging development.</p><p>Step 5: Brainstorming Educational Content</p><p>Finally, we asked Claude to help us brainstorm educational content ideas aligned with our core messaging. The AI suggested several ideas, including:</p><p>"The AI-Assisted Content Creation Playbook: How to Transform Your Workflows and Achieve 10x Efficiency"</p><p>and</p><p>"The Source Material Advantage: How to Leverage Your Unique Content with AI for Maximum Impact"</p><p>Aha Moment #5: The AI not only generated content ideas but also aligned them perfectly with our unique value proposition of leveraging quality source material in AI-assisted content creation.</p><p>Throughout this process, we were continually impressed by Claude's ability to understand context, make logical inferences, and provide structured, actionable outputs. However, we also recognized the crucial role of human input in guiding the AI and providing the nuanced understanding of our business and customers that no AI can replicate.</p>
