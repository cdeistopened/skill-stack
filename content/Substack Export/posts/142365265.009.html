<p>Traditional inbound and outbound marketing playbooks are losing their potency. Cold emails get caught in spam filters before anyone reads them. And most people are sick of being blatantly sold to at every turn.</p><p>Capturing attention and building trust with an audience today requires a new strategy—one that sidesteps the stereotypical promotional reek and overcomes people’s built-in defenses against being sold stuff they don’t need.</p><p>A new book by B2B partnerships veteran Jared Fuller provides name for an old way to do business. <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nearbound-Rise-Economy-Jared-Fuller/dp/B0CW3DKVQD/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Nearbound and the Rise of the Who Economy</a></em> details how you can put <strong>strategic partnerships</strong> at the core of your Go-To-Market strategy –&nbsp;whether you’re in software, media, or any other industry. While the book focuses on B2B SaaS companies, Fuller used the same “nearbound” principles to boostrap <a href="https://nearbound.com/">a media company of the same name</a>, starting with a podcast.</p><h3>The Nearbound Partner Strategy: A Win-Win Approach</h3><p>Trying to grow an audience through solo own content is an uphill battle. For one, you're limited to only your existing fans and followers. That's a tough way to expand your reach.</p><p>Plus, producing a constant stream of high-quality solo content is tedious. It requires superhuman levels of creativity and discipline to consistently put out material that keeps people engaged.</p><p><strong>The answer?</strong> </p><p>Join forces with other creators in your niche who share a similar message –&nbsp;something complementary but not identical. They have active audiences you can tap into simply by associating yourself with them. Co-creating content alongside these influencers is inherently more compelling than anything you could produce single-handedly. And it’s way easier. That’s why Rikk and I decided to start this podcast as a joint venture. No way would we be able to monologue for 45 minutes a week on these topics. But with a partner, it feels effortless.</p><p>Podcast interviews are an ideal vehicle to establish mini-partnerships with influential creators and experts in your niche—those who your target audience already trusts.</p><p>Instead of just pumping out another mediocre solo episode, invite these influencers as guests. Approach each interview as an opportunity to connect and create value through conversation.</p><p><strong>This is a 360 degree, win-win scenario:</strong></p><p>You get exposed to their existing audience, expanding your reach. Meanwhile, the guest receives quality audio/video content they can share to spotlight their ideas (without seeming self-promotional). The idea is to "make your guests famous" and create content so good that they can’t <strong>not</strong> share it.</p><p>You might be thinking, “How do I make people famous when I don’t have a big audience yet?”</p><p>More importantly, how do you even get interesting people to agree to be guests before you’ve demonstrated the ability to put their ideas in front of their target audience?</p><p>To start, never under-estimate people’s desire to hear themselves talk. In my experience producing podcasts, it’s rare to get an outright rejection as long as you have a functional and professional website with some content that demonstrates a certain quality threshold.</p><p>No, you’re not going to get Elon Musk on your podcast without a large audience and reputation for hosting similar-caliber guests, but that’s where the incremental “bootstrapping” approach comes in. The following steps are adapted from the marketing chapter of the <em>Nearbound</em> book. Read the whole thing if you’re interested in going deeper.</p><h3>Step 1: Build out the infrastructure</h3><p>The nearbound podcasting game is a long-term strategy. You need a <strong>system</strong>.</p><p>The first step is it to create the basic infrastructure for onboarding guests and capturing the content. You can use online scheduling tools like Calendly and Cal, with brief forms to gather the necessary info from your guest before the interview. They key is to frame the onboarding form as a benefit for the guest, not just another hoop for them to jump through.</p><p>Emphasize that you'll be using their input to properly introduce them, share the right links/calls-to-action, and customize promotional assets for their preferred social media networks.</p><h3>Step 2: Start with smaller creators/influencers in your niche</h3><p>It starts by identifying the smaller creators and influencers operating within your niche. They'll be the most eager for the exposure and audience growth that your partnership can provide. Plus, having an overlapping audience increases the relevance and appeal for both sides.</p><h3>Step 3: Provide quality audio/video and "mic drop" memorable moments</h3><p>From there, you need to bring your A-game in terms of production quality. Use a professional audio/video recording tool like Riverside, Squadcast, or Zencastr. With your questions, try to tee-up memorable "mic drop" moments that you can clip and share –&nbsp;speaking to the points and issues that they’re passionate about, but perhaps haven’t had an opportunity to express.</p><p>Step 4: Implement cross-promotion across all platforms</p><p>The real magic happens when you implement an intentional cross-promotion strategy across platforms. You promote the guest and their latest projects/offerings through your website, email lists, and social channels. It’s human nature to reciprocate. If you do a good job on your side, your guest will respond by promoting/reposting/forwarding the interview content and highlights to their audiences as well.</p><p>This cross-promotion taps into the guest's built-in community and strengthens the perception that you're a go-to destination for respected influencers to voice their ideas.</p><p>Step 5: Gradually work your way up to bigger names</p><p>As your authority and audience grows from consistently delivering valuable guest partnerships, you'll gradually be able to work your way up to bigger names and influencers. Your increased audience size and strengths in making guests look good becomes a powerful draw.</p><p>This strategy pays allows you to build an audience of raving fans—not just for your content, but for the guests and value you provide access to. And as you continue delivering that value, the partnership opportunities will just keep expanding organically.</p><p>Influential creators will be soon be pitching themselves to get on your show and reach your audience. Guests will willingly refer others in their network as potential partners. You'll have created a potent, self-perpetuating growth engine that attracts more and more stakeholders into your orbit.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Here’s a Template Email to Potential Guests that you can use and modify to your voice and style.</p><p>Subject: Idea for a Valuable Partnership?</p><p>Hi [Guest Name],</p><p>I've been following your work at [Their Company/Platform] and really admire what you're creating in the [niche/topic] space.
