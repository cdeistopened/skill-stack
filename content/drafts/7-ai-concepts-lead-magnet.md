# Lead Magnet: AI Concepts for 2025

Draft brainstorm for email-gated guide.

---

## Core Candidates (pick 7)

### Infrastructure Layer
1. **Markdown** — Text files that work everywhere. Your content becomes portable.
2. **SKILL.md** — Instructions for AI in a file. Turn any workflow into a reusable recipe.
3. **MCPs (Model Context Protocol)** — Plugins that give AI superpowers. Connect Claude to tools, databases, APIs.
4. **Wrappers** — Products built on top of foundation models. Cursor, Perplexity, Claude Code are wrappers. So is Gemini's image gen beast mode.

### Working With AI
5. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** — AI that reads your stuff first. Make it an expert on YOUR content.
6. **Context Windows** — How much AI can "see" at once. Why some tasks work and others break.
7. **Prompt Chains** — Breaking big tasks into small steps. The secret to reliable output.

### Agentic Patterns
8. **Agents** — AI that takes action, not just talks. Multi-step work, autonomously.
9. **Planning Mode + Interview** — The two-phase pattern: gather context first, then execute. Ask before you act.
10. **Tool Use** — AI calling external functions. Search, calculate, fetch, write files.

### Meta / Advanced
11. **System Prompts** — The hidden instructions that shape AI behavior. Every product has one.
12. **Temperature** — Randomness dial. Low for facts, high for creativity.
13. **Fine-tuning vs. Prompting** — When to train a custom model vs. just write better instructions.
14. **Embeddings** — Turning text into numbers for search. The math behind "similar content."
15. **Multimodal** — AI that sees images, hears audio, reads PDFs. Not just text anymore.

## Framing Ideas

**Title options:**
- "7 AI Concepts for 2025 — In Plain English"
- "The AI Vocabulary That Separates Beginners from Power Users"
- "7 Words That Will Define How You Work With AI"
- "The Only 7 AI Terms You Actually Need to Know"

**Angle:**
Most AI content is either too technical or too hype-y. This is the middle path — concepts explained simply, with examples you can try today.

**Structure per concept:**
1. One-sentence definition
2. Why it matters (job-to-be-done)
3. Concrete example / prompt you can try
4. Link to relevant Skill Stack skill or post

## Shortlist (my picks)

1. **Markdown** — foundation
2. **SKILL.md** — our differentiator
3. **MCPs** — timely, Claude just shipped this
4. **RAG** — everyone needs this, few understand it
5. **Agents** — the buzzword that actually matters
6. **Planning Mode + Interview** — practical pattern, not in other guides
7. **Wrappers** — helps people understand the landscape (Gemini, Cursor, etc.)

Alt: swap Wrappers for Context Windows if we want more technical depth.

## Notes

- Gemini image gen is a wrapper on top of foundation model
- Planning mode = Claude's /plan, Cursor's plan mode, etc.
- Interview pattern = ask questions before executing
- These two together = "gather context, then act"
