# Skills Ethos - Draft Notes

> Organized source material for lead essay on Skills philosophy and strategic narrative.

## Theme 1: Real-World Missions (Anti Zero-Sum)

**Core argument**: Content engines in service of something outside content itself.

**The tension**: Most content advice optimizes for attention capture in saturated markets. This is zero-sum. The alternative: create content that compounds value outside the attention economy.

**Examples of content serving a mission**:
- Local newsletter that connects neighbors (placeholder - expand with specific example)
- Podcast documenting expertise built in the field
- YouTube channel as front door to consulting practice
- Email list finding customers for something you make with your hands

**For young people**: Connect it to something real. Find a local business, start a neighborhood newsletter, document expertise through apprenticeship. The path with less competition creates real value for specific people in specific places.

**What this is NOT**: Competing on pure content optimization. Chasing the "best AI influencer product." But if you can teach, be amusing, combine aesthetics with pedagogy - go for it. Just serve something.

## Theme 2: Continuous Learning / Second Brain Realized

**Core argument**: The promise of second brain philosophers (Forte, Bradley, Frank) has finally been delivered - but through skills and agents, not static note systems.

**The breakthrough**: Static systems collapse under maintenance burden. You had to manually update them. Skills change this - they evolve as you use them. The system actually learns.

**Key concepts**:
- Skills + Claude Code + evolving context = continuous learning
- Agents as executors of agency/intent
- Magnifiers of agency, not replacements for thinking
- Best if you understand the levers and build it yourself
- personalOS and Claudesidian templates offer starting points
- Architecture of skills lends itself toward understanding (you can read a SKILL.md and see what it does)

**Critical distinction**: A skill isn't a one-time download. You have to set it up, adapt it, run it against your actual work. This is why teaching skill-building matters more than selling skills.

**From Anthropic "Skills > Agents" framing** (decide whether to cite directly):
- The more skills you build, the more useful Claude Code gets
- Procedural knowledge and continuous learning
- Skills make Claude Code more knowledgeable over time
- Collaborative - expands to teams, communities, orgs via plugins
- Useful for workflows where information constantly changes

## Theme 3: Personal Tech Stack

**Core argument**: Transparency about what actually works.

**The setup**:
- **Core**: Cursor running Claude Code via Anthropic extension (makes it more like regular chat)
- **Viewing**: Markdown previewer for pretty output
- **Economics**: Claude Code Max plan (5x) - plenty for heavy daily use
- **Specific tasks**: Gemini API key for image generation, transcription, OCR - long context window, brute force tokens
- **Fallback**: Codex CLI extension for occasional OpenAI tasks

**Philosophy**: Templates (personalOS, Claudesidian) offer good starting points. But real leverage comes from building it yourself, understanding the levers.

**Open question**: Why Cursor specifically? (answer needed)

## Theme 4: Skills Philosophy / Wizards

**Core argument**: Skills seem complicated even though they're just markdown. The barrier is conceptual, not technical.

**What makes skills hard**:
- Requires understanding themes from "Commanding the Page"
- English as programming language with fuzzier boundaries
- Logic and instruction execution based on your specific knowledge
- Not just copy-paste - you have to understand the "why"

**The wizard concept**: Help people customize a base skill to their own working version.

**Skill complexity factors**:
- API keys required
- MCP integrations
- Style ingestion (needs to ingest your outputs)
- Difficulty rating + time estimate for setup

**Examples of skill types by complexity**:
- Simple: Text transformation, formatting
- Medium: Voice matching (needs samples ingested)
- Complex: Image generation with aesthetic sense (API + iteration)
- Full workflow: Newsletter writer, podcast production (multiple integrations)

**Product vision**:
- Playground environment for developing skills
- GLIF integration for short-form video generation (half-baked - decide if ready)
- Determine elements needed, what videos to create

## Theme 5: Balance / Sustainability

**Core argument**: Balance hardcore AI engineering with hardcore outdoor play and embodied work.

**The insight**: Time to let thoughts rest. Best ideas rise after cruft settles.

**Environment design**: Set up for continuous learning without burnout.

**This might fold into another theme or stand alone - TBD**

## Open Questions

- [ ] Expand local newsletter example with specifics
- [ ] Decide: cite Anthropic talk directly or just reference concept?
- [ ] Answer: Why Cursor specifically?
- [ ] Is GLIF integration ready to mention?
- [ ] Where does balance/sustainability fit?

## Drafting Workflow Reminder

When drafting from these notes:
1. Load `skills/writing-style/SKILL.md`
2. Load `rules/human-writing.md`
3. Mine CONTENT_INDEX.md for supporting quotes/examples
4. Read-aloud test before finalizing
