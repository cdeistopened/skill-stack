## Transcript

**Logan Kilpatrick**: Hey everyone, welcome back to Release Notes. I'm Logan Kilpatrick from the Google DeepMind team. Today, we're sitting here in Mountain View joined by Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.

Gemini 3 has rolled out, Nano Banana Pro has rolled out, and the reception has been super positive. Can you frame this moment of progress for us? It feels like we are seeing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models not just with Gemini and Nano Banana Pro, but with Veo and music models across the board. It feels like we are hitting SOTA more frequently as time goes on.

**Sundar Pichai**: First of all, it's great to be here. It's been a phenomenal week. When you're working on things internally, you visualize the moment when you can finally put it all out there. When you work on products, there's nothing more exciting than that.

This week is built on a foundation of deep investments made over many years. It was always clear to me—you could see the pace at which we were making progress—but to see it all come together is really special. I was just reflecting that in the last couple of weeks, we've pretty much been shipping something every day. It's a great feeling.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: It is. I remember talking to you about a year and a half ago; I was complaining about something, and you pushed me to see the long-term perspective. To me, the story of getting to this moment—with state-of-the-art models and the infrastructure to scale Gemini across Google—is defined by that long-term view. Especially in this hyper-competitive moment where it feels like a rat race to hill-climb 1% on leaderboards, how do you maintain that long-term perspective?

**Sundar Pichai**: I always force myself to step back. We work in an industry where you move fast and want to iterate fast, and I really enjoy that. But making long-term bets and staying focused over time is super important.

In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be "AI-first." That moment was prompted by the 2012 Google Brain "cat paper" breakthrough in image classification, acquiring DeepMind in 2014, and the AlphaGo moment in January 2016. Many people didn't notice, but in May 2016, we also announced our first TPU. Seeing all that, it was clear to me we were about to go through another platform shift. That was the bet on a full-stack approach: setting up Google to be an AI-first company.

Since then, we have made so much progress. Many breakthroughs came from Google, including the Transformer. We were putting it into products like BERT, MUM, Search, and Google Photos. But with the generative AI moment, I realized the window was even bigger—consumers and developers were ready to use the technology at scale.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: So how do you respond to a moment like that?

**Sundar Pichai**: For us, it was kicking off Gemini as a project across Google Brain and DeepMind, and eventually bringing those teams together. We ramped up investments in our infrastructure—data centers, TPUs, GPUs. Then, it was about getting the company to move at a faster cadence.

Once the Google DeepMind team started shipping Gemini, the challenge became manifesting it in products that touch billions of users, like Search. When you have a full-stack approach, innovation at any layer flows all the way to the top.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: This is what I tell people about pre-training. The fact that pre-training for DeepMind is working so well in the Gemini models acts like an accelerant for post-training and RL [Reinforcement Learning]. I feel like our infrastructure is a similar story.

**Sundar Pichai**: Absolutely. You make your infrastructure better, which makes the models better at pre-training and post-training. Then you take those capabilities and manifest them in products—like Nano Banana appearing in products or Generative UI in Search. You also give it to developers to innovate on top of that. That creates a multiplicative effect.

Some of this took time. Because we have a full-stack approach, when we had to respond to the Gen AI moment, we were initially short on capacity. We had to invest heavily to ramp up. To the outside, it might have looked like we were quiet or behind, but we were putting the building blocks in place. We are on the other side of that now, which is why you see the teams moving forward at this pace.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: It's been incredible to see. A challenge now is "sim-shipping" [simultaneously shipping]—ensuring models show up well across all our different product experiences. At I/O this year, I had a realization: historically, other than your Google Account, there wasn't a strong through-line across Google's suite. Now, it feels like Gemini is that through-line across literally every single product, from Cloud to Waymo to Search to Gmail. It feels like there is something magic happening there.

**Sundar Pichai**: That's a good observation. Gemini is a very clear manifestation of the AI-first strategy. It improves everything from Search to YouTube to Cloud to Veo.

What I loved about the Gemini 3 launch was seeing the "sim-shipping" happen externally, too. On X, whether it was Copilot, Replit, or Figma, people were coming together. They are also sim-shipping. To me, that is innovation at scale. It's not just us; it's other companies in the world, which is extraordinary to see.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: Speaking of scale, let's talk about the "Nano Banana Pro" moment. I'm sure you've spent time playing with the model. People are going crazy with it, especially the infographics.

**Sundar Pichai**: I have to keep asking: did we improve the productivity of the world, or is it just net progress? The infographics seem amazing. Years ago, PowerPoint unleashed a phase where people kept making more and more slides with expanding information. Maybe with Nano Banana Pro, we are back to a phase where we can compress that information and give it to the world in a more digestible way.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: That's exactly where I was going. I've historically been skeptical about how useful generative media models would be for the world, but Nano Banana Pro crossed the chasm—specifically with infographics grounded in Google Search. I can clearly see how this fits Google's mission of organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible.

**Sundar Pichai**: It also shows me how much latent creativity exists in the world. People are going to express themselves, and we are giving them the tools to do it exactly the way they are thinking it in their heads. If we were previously constrained by tools, we are now creating more expressive, accessible ones.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: Tulsi suggested I ask you this: As you see these launches happen in these large tentpole moments for Google, what is your success barometer? Is it the reception online? Adoption on day one?

**Sundar Pichai**: I'm pretty active on launch day. I look for feedback—for example, on X—to understand how average users are experiencing the product. If I see a valid point, I'll ping people internally to address it. Internally, teams use Gemini to collate feedback, and we have great dashboards looking at QPS [Queries Per Second] and capacity.

But I need to feel it firsthand. On launch days, I try to have a less structured day so I can walk over to the teams that worked on the products and see how they feel. It's a combination of monitoring online, looking at data, and engaging with people.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: You can feel the excitement in the office right now. I can't walk anywhere without seeing some version of a banana—kudos to the facilities team for bringing 100,000 bananas into the building!

The exciting part is that this is just the first page of the Gemini 3 chapter. We don't have Flash yet or other 3.0 models. We shipped Gemini 2.5 Pro at I/O, and while competitors caught up, it was still best-in-class. Now we are taking it a step further.

**Sundar Pichai**: The Google DeepMind team is on a good cadence, pushing the frontier every six months or so. Taking a meaningful leap from a strong model like 2.5 Pro is hard, but that's what makes the progress exciting. I know you are always excited about Flash because it allows us to serve more people. I think 3.0 Flash is going to be a very good model—maybe our best one yet.

This culture of relentlessly innovating and shipping makes this moment special. It definitely feels like there's going to be a lot of exciting progress across all layers of the stack as we go into 2026.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: Josh on the team inspired me with his goofy answer about his launch day ritual—eating dried Cheerios. Do you have any weird launch day rituals?

**Sundar Pichai**: My morning ritual is usually to wake up and catch up on what's happening in the world before checking Google email. If something interesting has happened at Google, it'll be in the news anyway. On launch days, my ritual becomes focusing on our products in the news to understand how they are landing. And again, I try to keep the day unstructured to spend time with the teams.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: I have another observation. There is a "Blue Micro Kitchen" inside the Creating Canopy office where a lot of the DeepMind action happens. Every time I'm there, despite Google being huge and global, it makes the company feel small and intimate.

**Sundar Pichai**: It reminds me of early Google. You go there and might see Sergey [Brin], or Jeff [Dean] and Sanjay [Ghemawat] pair programming and making espressos. Nothing encapsulates our culture better than watching the precision with which they make espressos in that micro kitchen. It's dense in talent, people are constantly exchanging ideas, and it's definitely a favorite part of how the company works.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: A lot of this AI story has been about making really long-term investments 10 years ago—Cloud, Waymo, etc. How do you think about the next 10 years? Is it just infrastructure, or are there other bets? I keep seeing "vibe coding" mentioned, but are there other future-facing bets?

**Sundar Pichai**: It's always important to think in that timeframe. Waymo was a long bet, and now we are seeing that inflection point.

Quantum computing is an amazing bet. In about five years, I hope we'll have the same breathless excitement for Quantum as we do for AI today. Another example is Project Suncatcher, which we announced two weeks ago—building data centers in space. It looks crazy today, but when you envision the amount of compute we're going to need, it starts making sense. We are working back from milestones to hopefully have a TPU in space by 2027. We are also cooking up exciting work in robotics.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: When I saw TPUs going to space, I pinged Demis and said we should fund a moon rover with Gemini on-device to livestream exploring the moon.

**Sundar Pichai**: That would be a great marketing campaign. Who knows, maybe that project is underway somewhere!

**Logan Kilpatrick**: Let's talk about "vibe coding." I feel like capabilities are raising the floor for everyone to be creative. Creating software is one of the most economically powerful things in history, and now it is within reach of so many more people. How do you think about that moment?

**Sundar Pichai**: It's an exciting moment, similar to how the internet brought blogs and made people writers, or YouTube made people creators. You can feel it happening on the coding side. Even within Google, we see a sharp increase in people submitting their first CLs [Code Changes].

A product marketing person who previously would have just described an idea can now "vibe code" it and show it to people. I was just speaking with someone on my Comms team who doesn't code but used Gemini 3 to "one-shot" an animated HTML page to teach his son Spanish conjugation. It makes coding so much more enjoyable and approachable.

And the amazing thing is: this is the worst these tools will ever be. I used to say about Waymo, "Remember, this is the worst Waymo will ever drive; it will only get better." It's the same with vibe coding in Gemini 3 and AI Studio.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: It is awesome. My last question: What's next? What can we be excited for?

**Sundar Pichai**: Well, I think some folks need some sleep! But look, I'm excited for the Gemini roadmap and how it's coming to all our products. We're also shipping new things—I love Flow, and NotebookLM has a passionate, growing community. There's a lot more to come.

**Logan Kilpatrick**: I'm excited. Thank you, Sundar, for sitting down. And thank you everyone for watching Release Notes. We'll see you in the next episode.
