# Meta-Skill for Newsletters

## What
A skill that helps you write your own skills - specifically for newsletter creators.

## Part of Larger Vision
- Workspace generator: user picks platforms → gets full workspace with relevant skills
- Template library: podcast-to-book, unauthorized guide, newsletter formats
- Eventually: skills marketplace (like npm for AI skills)

## Next Action
Document one newsletter workflow as a skill first, then abstract the pattern
