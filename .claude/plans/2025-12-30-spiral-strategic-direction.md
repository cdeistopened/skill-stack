# Spiral Strategic Direction
**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Status:** Analysis complete, decision pending

---

## Summary

Deep strategic session to determine the direction for Spiral — the AI writing partner concept that builds on Skill Stack's philosophy.

## Key Decisions Made

### The Sparse Theory
> Spiral is a wizard that asks you what you're trying to say, remembers how you say it, and helps you say it better — one skill at a time.

### Four Irreducible Pillars Identified
1. **Wizard** — Substance extraction via questioning
2. **Substance** — The core insight being expressed
3. **Voice** — Captured writing style
4. **Skills** — Modular transformation cartridges

## The Strategic Fork

| Path | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **A: Join Every.to** | Distribution, resources, team | Lose ownership, optionality |
| **B: Build independent** | Full control, pure vision | No distribution, multi-year effort |
| **C: Hedge (current)** | Preserves options | Risks doing neither well |

## Network Effects Analysis

**Where moats could live:**
- Wizard refinement data (which questions work)
- Collaborative filtering ("writers like you")
- Remix chains and attribution
- Skill usage patterns

**What has no moat:**
- Skills (copyable markdown)
- Voice profiles (per-user, private)
- Philosophy (already public)

## Traps Identified

1. Building for imagined users vs. real demand
2. Comprehensiveness over sparse clarity
3. Social layer fantasy before individual power

## Recommended Path

1. Build one Claude Code skill (`/spiral`) embodying wizard pattern
2. Use on real work (Naval, OpenEd)
3. Share with 5 people, document results
4. Let evidence inform infrastructure decisions

## Relationship to Skill Stack

Spiral is the "on-ramp" that makes Skill Stack accessible to non-technical users. But the on-ramp shouldn't be built before validating the wizard pattern works.

**Sequence:**
1. Validate wizard pattern in Claude Code
2. Build audience through content
3. Build tool when distribution exists
