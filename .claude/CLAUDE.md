# Skill Stack - Project Context

> The meta-skill for the AI age: teaching people how to work *with* AI, not be replaced by it.

## About This Project

Skill Stack is a markdown blog/newsletter that will evolve into a **skills marketplace**—like npm for AI skills. Users can browse, filter, and download SKILL.md files, plus use a "Skill Wizard" to create and remix skills.

## The Author

**Charlie Deist** (@chdeist)
- Head of Content at OpenEd
- Producer for the Naval Podcast
- Background in ghostwriting, podcast production, and content transformation
- Lives in rural California with his family
- Thesis: "AI skill stacking + real-world skills = the distributist path forward"

## Core Philosophy

See [NARRATIVE.md](./NARRATIVE.md) for the full principles, but the essence:

1. **Transform, Don't Generate** — AI refines human ideas, not replaces them
2. **Sourcery > Sorcery** — Your raw material (transcripts, notes) is the secret ingredient
3. **Mechanical Sympathy** — Learn by doing, develop intuitive feel for AI
4. **The 4S Framework** — Source, Substance, Structure, Style
5. **Chain of Thought** — Break complex tasks into sequences
6. **Voice Matching** — "In the style of [writer]" encodes entire philosophies

## Content Structure

- `/content/blog/` — All published posts
- `/content/drafts/` — Work in progress
- `/public/book_media/` — Images from "Commanding the Page" book
- `/.claude/` — Knowledge and context documents

## Key References

- [CONTENT_INDEX.md](./CONTENT_INDEX.md) — Index of all content by topic
- [AUTHOR.md](./AUTHOR.md) — Personal context about Charlie
- [NARRATIVE.md](./NARRATIVE.md) — Core principles and thesis

## Writing Guidelines

**ALWAYS load `skills/writing-style/SKILL.md` for any writing task.** This is non-negotiable.

Core principles from that skill:
- **No correlative constructions** ("X isn't just Y—it's Z") — the #1 AI tell
- **Prose style**: Sweeney's meets Didion meets Pirate Wires. Dry wine, not dry magazine.
- **10th grade reading level**. Vary sentence length. Fragments for punch.
- **Headers sparingly**. Let prose breathe.
- **SEO descriptions**: 150-160 chars, keyword + insight + deliverable

When writing for Skill Stack:
- Lead with transformation, not generation
- Include concrete examples and prompts users can try
- Reference the CODER framework (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express, Refine)
- Avoid AI hype; focus on practical job-to-be-done
- Cite sources when building on others' ideas
- Write in Charlie's voice: conversational but substantive, literary references welcome

## Source Material

The blog draws from:
1. **"Commanding the Page" (2023)** — Charlie's book on AI-assisted writing
2. **Content Vikings Substack** (rebranded) — Newsletter archives
3. **Naval Podcast production notes** — Real-world workflow examples
4. **New original content** — Fresh articles on skills and AI

## Meta-Skill Vision

The ultimate goal: **a meta-skill that helps you write your own skills**.

### Workspace Generator Concept
- User specifies which platforms they focus on (newsletter, podcast, YouTube, etc.)
- Meta-skill creates their whole workspace with relevant skills
- Skills tap into different social media platforms
- Template library: podcast-to-book, unauthorized guide, newsletter formats

### Content Formats to Document
- Podcast guide on specific topic
- Overview/compilation format
- Bespoke customized approaches
- Newsletter with template and meta-skills

### Tasks
- [ ] Build meta-skill that creates skills for newsletters (see [[2025-12-29-meta-skill-newsletters]])
- [ ] Document the podcast-to-book workflow as a skill
- [ ] Create workspace generator prototype
- [ ] Scope (Un)Authorized project - create `unauthorized/` folder (see [[2025-12-29-unauthorized-project-scope]])
- [ ] Research unified creator IDE concept (see [[2025-12-29-unified-creator-ide]]) #priority/low

## Strategic Insights (2025-12-30 Oracle Session)

### The Sparse Theory
> **Spiral is a wizard that asks you what you're trying to say, remembers how you say it, and helps you say it better — one skill at a time.**

### Four Irreducible Pillars
1. **Wizard** — Questioning interface that extracts substance
2. **Substance** — The core insight being expressed
3. **Voice** — Captured writing style (the differentiator)
4. **Skills** — Modular transformation cartridges

### Key Insight: Substance Extraction is a Skill
Most people don't know what they want to say until someone helps them find it. The "wizard pattern" (ask one question at a time, branch based on answers) is genuinely underexplored in AI writing tools.

### The Network Effects Question
Skills are markdown files — infinitely copyable, no moat. The moat isn't the skills themselves. It's the **refinement data**: which questions work, which wizard paths lead to good outputs, which skill combinations succeed.

### Three Traps to Avoid
1. **Building for imagined users** — Have real users asked for this, or are we guessing?
2. **Comprehensiveness over clarity** — If you can add detail indefinitely, you don't have a theory yet
3. **Social layer fantasy** — Individual power first, social second (or never)

### The On-Ramp Problem
Skills work but are trapped in a distribution format (Claude Code + markdown) that excludes 95% of potential users. The gap isn't the product. It's the on-ramp.

### Recommended Next Step
Build one Claude Code skill (`/spiral` or `/write`) that embodies the wizard pattern. Use it on real work. Share with 5 people. Document what happens.
