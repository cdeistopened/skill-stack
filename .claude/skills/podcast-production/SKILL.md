# Podcast Production Skill

## Overview

Transform a raw podcast transcript into polished, multi-platform content assets through four strategic checkpoints. Each checkpoint delivers decision-ready analysis in a markdown file for your feedback before proceeding. You'll provide feedback directly in the checkpoint documents, then we'll iterate before moving to the next phase. Final outputs include publication-ready YouTube strategy and a narrative-driven blog post.

**Workflow Structure:**
- Start with `[Guest]_Source_Material.md` (raw transcript + notes)
- Create `Checkpoint_1_Comprehensive_Analysis.md` (your feedback here)
- Create `Checkpoint_2_Cold_Opens_and_Clips.md` (your feedback here)
- Create `Checkpoint_3_YouTube_Strategy.md` (your feedback here)
- Create `Checkpoint_4_Polished_Transcript_and_Blog.md` (final deliverable)

## When to Use This Skill

- You have a raw podcast transcript and need to identify the strongest marketing angle
- You want to create a cold open that hooks listeners immediately
- You need YouTube titles and thumbnail strategies
- You're creating social clips from podcast material
- You want to create SEO-optimized blog content from the episode

## KEY PRINCIPLES

### Verbatim Only
All quoted transcript must be exactly as spoken. You can cut/rearrange, never paraphrase.

### Mine the Entire Transcript
Don't limit analysis to one section. The strongest angle might be anywhere.

### Bold Over Safe
Surprising, contrarian moments beat safe, obvious observations.

### Story Over Summary
Create narrative momentum. Clips should have complete arcs, not just be "good quotes."

### Simple Over Complex
- Thumbnails: 3 elements max
- Titles: One clear idea
- Clips: Clear beginning, middle, end

### Brand Aligned
All outputs should reflect your brand's visual and tonal guidelines. Your target audience should see themselves.

## QUALITY GATES (At Each Decision Point)

### Before Checkpoint 1 -> Checkpoint 2:
**Is the analysis complete?**
- All 5 Big Ideas clearly differentiate from each other?
- One Big Idea is "the obvious choice" for marketing?
- Have you mined the entire transcript (not just first/last sections)?
- Quote bank is organized by theme?
- Chapter outline matches actual content?

### Before Checkpoint 2 -> Checkpoint 3:
**Does the cold open work?**
- Passes 4 out of 5 quality tests? (Stranger, Itch, Stakes, Tease, Emotion)
- Ends with unresolved cliffhanger (doesn't answer the question)?
- All clips are verbatim (no paraphrasing)?
- Duration is 22-35 seconds?
- Social clips have distinct angles (not all making same point)?
- On-screen hooks are 2-4 words max?

### Before Checkpoint 3 -> Checkpoint 4:
**Is the strategy aligned?**
- YouTube title clearly communicates core finding?
- Title includes guest name for authority?
- Thumbnail is simple (2-4 words only)?
- Thumbnail visual is complementary (not redundant with title)?
- Description hook is compelling (1 sentence)?
- Chapter titles are 5-10 words (keyword-rich, compelling)?
- All resources/links are correct?
- Aligned with your brand?

### Before Checkpoint 4 -> Publication:
**Are final assets publication-ready?**
- Transcript is clean and readable?
- Blog post is ~1,000 words with clear narrative arc?
- All quotes are verbatim with proper attribution?
- Guest bio includes credentials and links?
- SEO headers present and optimized?
- Tone is conversational (sounds like you, not formal)?
- Ready for blog publishing?
- Social clips ready to post with on-screen hooks?

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- Using only one section of transcript (mine the entire episode)
- Paraphrasing quotes (all quotes must be verbatim)
- Creating complex thumbnails (keep to 3 elements max)
- Choosing the "safe" angle instead of the surprising one
- Making cold open too long (25-35 seconds max)
- Resolving the cliffhanger (always cut before the answer)
- Skipping quality gates (get approval before each phase)
- Making blog post too long or too short (target ~1,000 words)
- Burying guest credentials (introduce early and naturally)
- Writing blog post in formal tone (write like you're talking to your audience)
