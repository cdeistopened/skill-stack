## CHECKPOINT 2 OUTPUT FORMAT

### Cold Open Script

**Requirements:**
- Duration: 15-60 seconds total
- All quotes must be verbatim (exactly as spoken)

**Example:**

```
(00:00-00:05)
GUEST: [Opening statement that hooks the viewer]

(00:05-00:13)
GUEST: [Building tension with surprising insight or data]

(00:13-00:15)
GUEST: [Strong declarative statement]

(00:15-00:28)
HOST: So when they asked [audience] what's [key question]...

GUEST: [Cliffhanger statistic or revelation. Nothing else came close.]
```

**Quality Gates:**
- Passes 4 out of 5 quality tests (Stranger, Itch, Stakes, Tease, Emotion)
- Ends with unresolved cliffhanger

**Example (for each social clip):**

```
Clip 1: "[Contrasting statement A] vs [Contrasting statement B]. Every time."

Clip 2: "Your [common worry] might be the best thing for them."

Clip 3: "We'd rather blame [popular scapegoat] than admit the truth."
```

**Design Notes:**

---

## CLIP SELECTION GUIDELINES

**Choose 3 clips that:**
- Have distinct emotional angles (not repetitive)
- Tell complementary stories (together they build a case)
- Are 1:00-1:30 in duration (long enough to feel complete, short enough to hold attention)
- Have clear beginning, middle, end (narrative arc)
- Stand alone compelling (work without context from full episode)
- Feature compelling on-screen hooks (2-4 words max)
- Appeal to target audience
- Feature direct quotes, not summaries (verbatim only)

---

## QUALITY GATES FOR CHECKPOINT 2

Before moving to Checkpoint 3, verify:

**Cold Open Quality:**
- Stranger: Opens with surprise/contradiction
- Itch: Creates curiosity that demands answer
- Stakes: Makes listener care about the outcome
- Tease: Ends with unresolved question (doesn't answer it)
- Emotion: Touches emotional truth (guilt, validation, hope, etc.)

**Cold Open Technical:**
- Duration: 22-35 seconds
- All clips verbatim (no paraphrasing)
- Clear speaker labels and timestamps
- Arranged for narrative momentum (not chronological)

**Social Clips:**
- 3 clips with distinct angles
- Each 1:00-1:30 duration
- Clear on-screen hooks (2-4 words max)
- All verbatim transcripts
- Platform recommendations
- Clear use case for each

**On-Screen Text:**
- 2-4 words maximum
- Complementary (not redundant with clip)
- Readable on mobile (280px width)
- Engaging/surprising statement

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- Cold open that resolves the tension (always cut before the answer)
- Paraphrased quotes (must be verbatim)
- Clips that don't work standalone (need context from episode)
- On-screen text longer than 4 words (not readable on mobile)
- On-screen text that repeats what the video already shows (redundant)
- All clips making the same point (should have distinct angles)
- Cold open longer than 35 seconds (loses audience)
- Missing platform recommendations (social team needs to know best use)

---

- [ ] One selected cold open script (22-35 seconds, verbatim clips, unresolved ending)

---

## NEXT PHASE: CHECKPOINT 3

Checkpoint 3 takes the approved cold open and clips and develops:
- YouTube title + thumbnail (with guest name)
- YouTube description (hook + full description + resources)
- Chapter breakdown (5-10 words per chapter, keyword-rich)
- All clips organized with final on-screen hooks
