# Podcast Production - References

This folder contains templates for each checkpoint in the podcast production workflow.

## Templates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `checkpoint-1-template.md` | Comprehensive analysis template (Big Ideas, clips, quote bank) |
| `checkpoint-2-template.md` | Cold opens and social clips template with quality gates |
| `checkpoint-3-template.md` | YouTube strategy template (title, thumbnail, chapters) |
| `checkpoint-4-template.md` | Polished transcript and blog post template |

## How to Use

1. **Checkpoint 1**: Use to structure your initial analysis of the raw transcript
2. **Checkpoint 2**: Use to format cold open scripts and social clip packages
3. **Checkpoint 3**: Use to create clean handoff specs for video production
4. **Checkpoint 4**: Use to format final polished assets for publication

## Key Principles Across All Checkpoints

- **Verbatim Only**: All quoted transcript must be exactly as spoken
- **Mine the Entire Transcript**: The strongest angle might be anywhere
- **Bold Over Safe**: Surprising, contrarian moments beat safe observations
- **Story Over Summary**: Create narrative momentum with complete arcs
- **Simple Over Complex**: Thumbnails (3 elements), titles (one idea), clips (clear arc)

## Quality Gates

Each checkpoint has specific quality gates that must pass before moving to the next phase. See individual templates for checkpoint-specific gates.
