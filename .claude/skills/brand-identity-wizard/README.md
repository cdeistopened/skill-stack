# Brand Identity Wizard

Create a comprehensive brand identity document that content skills can reference for consistent voice, messaging, and audience targeting.

## Quick Start

1. Open Claude Desktop or Claude.ai
2. Upload this folder (or the SKILL.md file)
3. Say: "I want to create a brand identity"
4. Follow the wizard prompts

## What's Inside

```
brand-identity-wizard/
├── SKILL.md           # The complete 5-section framework
├── WIZARD.md          # Conversational guide for setup
├── README.md          # This file
├── references/
│   └── (example brand identity docs)
└── templates/
    └── brand-identity.template.md
```

## Three Paths

**A) Extract from existing materials** — You have a website, content, maybe a style guide
**B) Build from scratch** — New brand, new voice, define everything
**C) Update an evolved brand** — Things have changed, time to refresh

## What You'll Need

- 30-60 minutes
- Access to existing brand materials (if any)
- Decision-making authority on brand voice

## What You'll Get

A `brand-identity.md` file containing:

1. **Brand Persona** — Who the brand is as a person
2. **Target Audience** — Who it serves and their transformation
3. **Voice & Tone** — How it speaks and writes
4. **Values & Mission** — What it stands for and against
5. **Messaging Framework** — Tagline, elevator pitch, key messages

## Why This Matters

Many content skills need brand context:
- Newsletter skills need voice and audience
- Podcast skills need interview style and framing
- Social skills need platform personalities

A single brand identity document lets all skills reference the same source of truth.

## Usage

Once created, reference your brand identity in:
- **CLAUDE.md** — "For brand context, see brand-identity.md"
- **Individual skills** — "Load voice from brand-identity.md"
- **Content production** — Quick reference for key messaging
