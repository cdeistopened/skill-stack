# Brand Identity Wizard

*A conversation to capture your brand identity in about 30 minutes.*

---

## Welcome

I'll help you create a brand identity document - a single file that captures who your brand is, who it serves, how it speaks, and what it stands for.

The result: a `brand-identity.md` file that other content skills can reference for consistent voice and messaging.

---

## First Question

**What's your starting point?**

**A) "I have existing brand materials"**
You have a website, past content, maybe a style guide. We'll extract and formalize what exists.

**B) "I'm building from scratch"**
New brand, new voice. We'll discover and define everything from the ground up.

**C) "My brand has evolved"**
Things have changed. We need to update outdated identity documents.

*Type A, B, or C to continue.*

---

## Path A: Existing Materials

Let's extract what already exists.

**Share what you have:**
- Website URL
- Past content you're proud of
- Any existing style guides or brand documents
- Social profiles

I'll analyze these and draft your brand identity, then we'll refine together.

---

## Path B: From Scratch

We'll build your brand identity through a series of questions.

**Let's start with the basics:**

1. What's the brand name?
2. What does this brand do? (One sentence)
3. Why does it exist? (What problem does it solve?)

---

## Path C: Evolution

Tell me what's changed:
- What parts of your current identity still feel right?
- What feels outdated or off?
- What triggered the need to update?

Share your existing brand documents and we'll update what needs changing while preserving what still works.

## Section 1: Brand Persona

*Who is your brand if it were a person?*

### Questions:

**1. If your brand were a person sitting across from your customer, who would they be?**
- What's their background?
- What makes them qualified to help?
- What's their story?

**2. What's their personality?**
Pick where you fall on each spectrum:
- Warm ←→ Reserved
- Expert ←→ Peer
- Serious ←→ Playful
- Formal ←→ Casual

**3. What do they believe that others might disagree with?**
Not safe values everyone agrees with - what hills will this brand die on?

**4. What's their superpower?**
What do they do better than anyone else?

---

## Section 2: Target Audience

*Who does this brand serve?*

### Questions:

**1. Describe your ideal reader/customer:**
- Age, profession, life stage?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What's frustrating them right now?

**2. Where are they now vs. where do they want to be?**
- Current state (the problem)
- Desired state (the transformation)

**3. How do they describe their problem?**
In their words - not industry jargon. What do they Google? What do they complain about to friends?

**4. Who else might read your content?**
Secondary audiences and how their needs differ.

---

## Section 3: Voice & Tone

*How does your brand speak?*

### Questions:

**1. Rate your voice on these spectrums (1-5):**

```
Formal ←――1――2――3――4――5――→ Casual
Expert ←――1――2――3――4――5――→ Peer
Serious ←―1――2――3――4――5――→ Playful
Reserved ←1――2――3――4――5――→ Opinionated
Abstract ←1――2――3――4――5――→ Concrete
```

**2. Sentence patterns:**
- Do you write short and punchy? Long and flowing? Variable?
- Any signature phrases or structures?

**3. Word choice:**
- Simple words or sophisticated vocabulary?
- Use contractions?
- Industry jargon - embrace, explain, or avoid?
- Any profanity or strong language?

**4. What should this brand NEVER do?**
- Phrases to avoid?
- Tones that are off-brand?
- Common mistakes to prevent?

---

## Section 4: Values & Mission

*What does this brand stand for?*

### Questions:

**1. In one sentence, why does this brand exist?**

**2. What are 3-5 core values - not aspirational, but actually practiced?**
For each: how does it show up in your content?

**3. What does this brand stand FOR?**
Positions, causes, movements it supports.

**4. What does this brand stand AGAINST?**
What does it oppose or challenge? What conventional wisdom does it reject?

---

## Section 5: Messaging Framework

*Reusable messaging elements*

### Questions:

**1. Tagline (10 words or less):**
How do you describe the brand in a single phrase?

**2. Elevator pitch (30 seconds):**
The full explanation - what, for whom, why.

**3. Key messages (3-5):**
Core themes that should appear across all content. What should every piece reinforce?

**4. Proof points:**
- Credentials or qualifications
- Stats that demonstrate value
- Testimonials or success stories

**5. Content themes:**
- What topics are always relevant?
- What's off-limits?

---

## Synthesis

Based on our conversation, I'm compiling your brand identity document.

*[Generate full brand-identity.md using the template]*

**Review:**
- Does the persona feel right?
- Is the audience specific enough?
- Does the voice sound like you?
- Are the values actionable?

What would you adjust?

---

## Saving Your Brand Identity

Your `brand-identity.md` file is ready.

**To use it:**
1. Save to your vault root or `.claude/` folder
2. Reference it in other skills: "Load voice from brand-identity.md"
3. Add to CLAUDE.md: "For brand context, see brand-identity.md"

---

## What's Next?

Your brand identity powers these skills:
- **voice-analyzer** — Create a detailed voice skill from writing samples
- **anti-ai-writing** — Ensure content matches brand authentically
- **hook-and-headline-writing** — On-brand attention grabbers
- **social-content-creation** — Platform-specific posts

Would you like help with any of these?

---

## Maintenance

Update your brand identity when:
- You notice content feeling off-brand
- Your audience has shifted
- Your positioning has evolved
- Quarterly, as a check-in

The document should be a living reference, not a historical artifact.

---

*One conversation. One document. Consistent brand across everything.*
