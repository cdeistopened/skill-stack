# Sticky Sentence Techniques

Literary devices that make sentences memorable, quotable, and "sticky" in readers' minds.

## What Makes a Sentence Sticky?

- **Quotable** - People want to share it
- **Simple** - Not complex or convoluted

## The 5 Core Techniques

### 1. Alliteration
### 2. Symmetry
### 3. Contrast
### 4. Rhyme
### 5. Rhythm

---

## Technique 1: Alliteration

### Definition
Using words that start with the same sound in close succession

### Why It Works
- Creates pleasing sound pattern
- Easier to remember (brain likes patterns)
- Adds emphasis and rhythm
- Feels intentional and crafted

### Examples

- "Specificity is the secret." - @ItsKieranDrew
- "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed." - Naval Ravikant
- "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Steve Jobs
- "Permission beats perfectionism."
- "Make writing the medium. Make exploration the habit."
- "Progress prefers patience."
- "Clarity creates confidence."
- "Structure supports, it doesn't suffocate."
- "Mastery matters more than motion."

### Formula
```
[S-word] is the [S-word]
[P-word] [P-word] [P-word]
[Word] beats [similar-sound-word]
```

### How to Create

**Step 1:** Identify your core message
Example: "Being specific helps"

**Step 2:** Find synonyms starting with same letter
- Specific → specificity
- Helps → secret, solution, superpower

**Step 3:** Combine for impact
Result: "Specificity is the secret"

**Practice Exercise:**
Take these concepts and make them alliterative:
- "Freedom is important" → "Freedom over formality"
- "Community matters" → "Community creates connection"
- "Questions help thinking" → "Questions quicken curiosity"

## Technique 2: Symmetry

### Definition
Creating balance in sentence structure through parallel phrases

### Why It Works
- Creates satisfying rhythm
- Emphasizes contrast or connection
- Easier to remember (pattern matching)
- Feels complete and authoritative

### Examples

- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations." - Naval Ravikant
- "Make writing the medium. Make exploration the habit."
- "A lack of negatives outweighs an abundance of positives."
- "Design for function. Build for beauty."
- "Input shapes output. Environment shapes behavior."
- "Amateurs focus on tactics. Professionals focus on systems."
- "Busy people count hours. Effective people count outcomes."
- "Credentials signal past learning. Skills signal current capability."

### Formula

**Pattern A: [Action 1] for [outcome]. [Action 2] for [outcome].**
- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "Learn for knowledge. Create for impact."

**Pattern B: It's not [X]. It's [Y].**
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations."
- "It's not about talent. It's about reps."

**Pattern C: [Noun 1] [verb] [object]. [Noun 2] [verb] [object].**
- "Amateurs focus on tactics. Professionals focus on systems."
- "Managers deliver tasks. Leaders deliver vision."

### How to Create

**Step 1:** Identify two related concepts
Example: "Input vs Output"

**Step 2:** Find parallel structures
- Both can be "shaped by" something
- Input shapes → behavior, skills, mindset
- Output shapes → results, reputation, growth

**Step 3:** Create balance
Result: "Input shapes output. Environment shapes behavior."

**Practice Exercise:**
Create symmetrical sentences for:
- Short-term vs long-term thinking
- Effort vs results
- Consumption vs creation

---

## Technique 3: Contrast

### Definition
Juxtaposing opposing ideas to create impact

### Why It Works
- Highlights extremes
- Forces binary choice
- Creates tension and resolution
- Memorable because of stark difference

### Examples

- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere." - Letters from a Stoic
- "Your simple guide to massive results."
- "Be clear, not clever. Concise, not complex." - @ItsKieranDrew
- "Strong opinions, loosely held."
- "Think big. Start small."
- "Small team. Big impact."
- "Less effort, more leverage."
- "Simple system. Profound results."
- "Short sprints. Deep work."
- "Fewer options, better decisions."
- "No meetings, real progress."

### Formula

**Pattern A: [Adjective 1], not [Adjective 2]**
- "Clear, not clever"
- "Simple, not simplistic"
- "Bold, not reckless"

**Pattern B: [Small thing]. [Big impact].**
- "Small team. Big impact."
- "One decision. Everything changes."

**Pattern C: [A] to [extreme]. [B] to [opposite extreme].**
- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere."
- "To do everything is to do nothing."

### How to Create

**Step 1:** Identify your point
Example: "Small teams can achieve a lot"

**Step 2:** Find opposing descriptors
- Small ↔ Big
- Few ↔ Many
- Simple ↔ Complex

**Step 3:** Create tension
Result: "Small team. Big impact."

**Practice Exercise:**
Create contrasts for:
- Flexibility vs rigidity
- Slow and steady vs fast and scattered
- Old methods vs new approaches

---

## Technique 4: Rhyme

### Definition
Using words with similar ending sounds

- Feels playful and intentional
- Creates rhythm
- Easy to recall

### Examples

- "Plan your work and work your plan."
- "You can't soar with eagles if you hang with turkeys."
- "If it doesn't make dollars, it doesn't make sense."
- "Clarity brings charity." (people help what they understand)
- "Build community, create unity."
- "Flexibility isn't inability."

### Formula

**Pattern A: [Action] or [rhyming consequence]**
- "Tell a story or lose your glory"
- "Show the proof or lose the truth"

**Pattern B: [Concept], [rhyming concept]**
- "Community creates unity"
- "Consistency builds persistency"

### How to Create

**Step 1:** Identify core message
Example: "Community is important"

**Step 2:** Find rhyming words related to message
- Community → unity, opportunity
- Important → alignment, excitement

**Step 3:** Craft sentence
Result: "Build community, create unity."

**Warning:** Easy to sound cheesy. Use sparingly and ensure it adds value, not just rhymes.

**Practice Exercise:**
Create rhymes for:
- Consistency leads to success
- Taking action matters
- Building trust

## Technique 5: Rhythm

### Definition
Creating a pleasing cadence in your sentence through word choice and structure

### Why It Works
- Easier to say aloud (more shareable)
- Creates flow and momentum

- "Ship fast. Learn faster."
- "Start small. Stay consistent. Scale later."
- "Less talking, more doing. Less planning, more shipping."
- "Small bets. Quick wins. Real momentum."
- "Find the pain. Build the solution. Own the market."
- "Question everything. Test constantly. Iterate forever."

### Formula

**Pattern A: Short. Punchy. Fragments.**
- "Small bets. Quick wins. Real momentum."
- "No fluff. No filler. Just value."

**Pattern B: [The more X, the more Y]**
- "The more you learn, the more you earn."
- "The less you do, the more you accomplish."

**Pattern C: [Action A]. [Action B]. [Result].**
- "Find the pain. Build the solution. Own the market."
- "Set the goal. Do the work. Trust the process."

### How to Create

**Step 1:** List your key points
Example:
- Identify the problem
- Create the solution
- Capture the market

**Step 2:** Use short, similar-length phrases
- Find → Build → Own (parallel verbs)
- The pain → the solution → the market (similar structure)

**Step 3:** Test it aloud
Result: "Find the pain. Build the solution. Own the market."

**Practice Exercise:**
Create rhythmic sentences for:
- Your morning routine (list 3 elements)
- How to build an audience
- Why simplicity wins

## Combining Techniques

### Symmetry + Contrast
"Amateurs focus on tactics. Professionals focus on systems."

❌ **Sacrificing clarity for style** - Sticky means nothing if the meaning is unclear
❌ **Overusing rhyme** - Can sound childish or forced
❌ **Being too clever** - Remember: "Be clear, not clever"
❌ **Using all techniques at once** - Usually 1-2 is most powerful
