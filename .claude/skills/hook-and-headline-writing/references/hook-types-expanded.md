## 1. Curiosity Hooks

**Goal:** Create information gap that compels reading

**Techniques:**
- State what and why, leave out how
- State start and end, leave out middle
- Make bold claim, leave out data/proof

**Formulas:**

| Formula | Structure | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Years of Experience | "[X] years in [field]. Here's what [audience] should know:" | "10 years in SEO. Here's what every new digital marketer should know:" |
| Bold Claim Teaser | "[Surprising result]. Here's what happened:" | "I turned 33 today. I weighed in at 337lbs this week. Here's what happened and how I'll lose 140lbs in the next 18 months:" |
| Number Teaser | "[X] [things]. Here's the [best/worst/most important]:" | "I've tested 100+ productivity apps. Here are the only 3 you need:" |

**When to use:**
- Content that reveals process, method, or surprising insight
- You have valuable "how" information to share
- Audience already understands the "what" and wants the "how"

**Examples:**

```

"Most founders fail at fundraising. Here's why:"
[Creates gap: what's the reason? Reader wants to know]

```

**Target Callout + Curiosity:**
```
"Founders raising pre-seed: VCs look for these 3 signals.
Most pitch decks miss #2:"
[Targets specific audience + creates information gap]
```

**Authority + Transformation:**
```
"I coached 100+ creators to their first $10K month.

[Establishes authority + promises transformation path]
```
