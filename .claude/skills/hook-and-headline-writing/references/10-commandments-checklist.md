# 10 Commandments of Engagement Checklist

A systematic checklist for optimizing hooks and headlines based on proven psychological principles.

## How to Use This Checklist

**Purpose:** Evaluate and improve your top 5-7 hook variations before final selection

**Workflow:**
1. Generate 10+ hook variations (Phase 2 of main skill)
2. Select top 5-7 based on frameworks used
3. Run each through this checklist
4. Score: Count how many commandments each hook applies (aim for 4-6)
5. Optimize: Add missing commandments where natural
6. Select: Choose hook with highest score + best fit

**Important:** You don't need all 10 in every hook. Aim for 4-6. More than 7 risks feeling manipulative.

## The 10 Commandments

### 1. Numbers and Statistics
### 2. Negativity Bias
### 3. Pattern Interrupt
### 4. Target Callout
### 5. Problem Callout
### 6. Confidence and Conviction
### 7. Aesthetics
### 8. Potential Benefit
### 9. Social Proof
### 10. Warning and Caution

---

## Commandment 1: Numbers and Statistics

### Principle
Use specific numbers to add credibility and reduce vagueness

### Why It Works
- Brain processes numbers faster than words
- Specificity implies accuracy and research
- Concrete vs abstract (easier to visualize)
- Creates curiosity ("Why that specific number?")

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook include a specific number?
- [ ] Are percentages, dollar amounts, or timeframes included?
- [ ] Have I avoided vague words like "many," "some," "lots"?
- [ ] Is the number realistic and accurate?

### Examples

**❌ Without numbers:**
- "Many businesses are using this strategy now"
- "Lots of people are making this mistake"
- "Save time with these tips"

**✅ With numbers:**
- "1.5 million businesses are using this strategy now"
- "90% of new founders make this mistake"
- "Save 100+ hours with these 7 tips"

### Types of Numbers to Use
- Percentages: "76% satisfaction rate"
- Dollar amounts: "$12,000 saved per year"
- Timeframes: "In 90 days"
- Quantities: "7 strategies"
- Specific results: "From 100 to 10,000 followers"
- Ratios: "1 person, 8 clients"

### When to Skip
- Number would be misleading or inaccurate
- Context is purely qualitative
- Too many numbers create clutter

---

## Commandment 2: Negativity Bias

### Principle
Highlight potential losses, mistakes, or negative consequences

### Why It Works
- Humans are wired to avoid loss more than seek gain
- Fear of missing out (FOMO) is powerful motivator
- Mistakes are more memorable than successes
- Creates urgency ("I need to fix this")

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook warn of a potential loss?
- [ ] Are consequences of inaction clear?
- [ ] Does it identify what reader might be missing?
- [ ] Is the fear legitimate (not manipulative)?

### Examples

**❌ Positive framing only:**
- "How to succeed at freelancing"
- "Great tips for productivity"
- "Build a better business"

**✅ Negativity bias applied:**
- "The costly mistake 90% of freelancers make"
- "What you're missing about deep work"
- "Stop doing this before it kills your business"

### Ways to Apply
- **Mistake focus:** "Are you making this [X] mistake?"
- **Loss aversion:** "What [inaction] is costing you"
- **Warning:** "Before you [action], read this"
- **Missing out:** "What [group] doesn't want you to know"
- **Consequence:** "Why [common practice] is killing [goal]"

### When to Skip
- Content is purely inspirational
- Audience is already anxious (don't add more fear)
- Loss framing would be manipulative

### Balance with Positivity
Don't make everything negative. Best hooks often pair:
- Negative hook + positive solution
- "Stop [problem]. Start [solution]."

---

## Commandment 3: Pattern Interrupt

### Principle
Challenge common beliefs, practices, or expectations

### Why It Works
- Breaks through scrolling/scanning autopilot
- Creates cognitive dissonance ("Wait, what?")
- Signals non-obvious content
- Makes reader pause and reconsider

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook challenge a common assumption?
- [ ] Would it make someone stop mid-scroll?
- [ ] Is it surprising or counterintuitive?
- [ ] Does it contradict conventional wisdom?

### Examples

**❌ Expected/conventional:**
- "Why you should plan your content calendar"
- "How to grow your audience effectively"
- "The importance of credentials"

**✅ Pattern interrupt:**
- "Forget everything you know about content strategy"
- "The less you plan, the more you ship"
- "Why the best founders have zero traditional credentials"

### Ways to Apply
- **Forget everything:** "Forget what you know about [topic]"
- **Opposite claim:** "The less [X], the more [Y]"
- **Surprising stat:** "98% don't know [surprising fact]"
- **Challenge authority:** "[Experts] are wrong about [topic]"
- **Reverse conventional wisdom:** "Why [common practice] actually hurts"

### Types of Pattern Interrupts

**1. Reversal:**
"The less you post, the more you grow"

**2. Negation:**
"Stop tracking vanity metrics. Start tracking revenue."

**3. Paradox:**
"The hardest path is often the easiest"

**4. Contradiction:**
"My business grew 10x when I started working 4 hours a day"

### When to Skip
- Content doesn't actually challenge assumptions
- You're being contrarian just for attention
- The interrupt would confuse rather than intrigue

---

## Commandment 4: Target Callout

### Principle
Directly address your specific audience by name or situation

### Why It Works
- Immediate self-selection ("This is for me")
- Increases relevance perception
- Cuts through noise for niche audiences
- Shows you understand them specifically

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook name the target audience?
- [ ] Would readers immediately know if it's for them?
- [ ] Is the audience specific (not just "entrepreneurs" or "people")?
- [ ] Does it reference their unique context?

### Examples

**❌ Generic audience:**
- "Tips for better productivity"
- "How to grow a business"
- "Advice for professionals"

**✅ Target callout:**
- "Solopreneurs: Stop trading time for money"
- "Burned-out corporate employees: Here's your exit plan"
- "For creators considering going full-time:"

### Ways to Apply

**1. Direct address:**
"[Audience name]: [Message]"
- "Remote workers: The productivity system that actually works"

**2. Situation callout:**
"If you're [specific situation], [message]"
- "If your business is stuck at $10K/month, read this"

**3. Pain point specificity:**
"For [audience] struggling with [specific problem]"
- "For freelancers drowning in client work"

**4. Identity-based:**
"[Role/identity] need to know this:"
- "Senior developers who secretly hate managing people"

### Levels of Specificity

**Too broad:**
- "Entrepreneurs" (which entrepreneurs?)
- "Marketers" (what kind? what context?)

**Good:**
- "Solo consultants"
- "First-time founders"

**Very specific (often best):**
- "Solo consultants in their first 90 days"
- "Burned-out agency owners considering going solo"

### When to Skip
- Content applies to everyone equally
- Being too specific would exclude valuable readers
- Platform/context makes audience obvious

---

## Commandment 5: Problem Callout

### Principle
Identify the specific pain point, struggle, or obstacle immediately

### Why It Works
- Shows you understand their struggle
- Creates instant relatability
- Signals relevant solution incoming
- Pain is more motivating than gain initially

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook name a specific problem?
- [ ] Would readers recognize this pain point?
- [ ] Is it concrete (not vague like "doing better")?
- [ ] Does it tap into real frustration?

### Examples

**❌ Vague or no problem:**
- "Tips for business growth"
- "How to improve marketing"
- "Better productivity approaches"

**✅ Problem callout:**
- "Tired of posting daily with zero engagement?"
- "Drowning in tools you never use?"
- "Spending $15K/month on ads with no ROI?"

### Ways to Apply

**1. Question format:**
"Tired of [specific problem]?"
- "Tired of endless meetings that accomplish nothing?"

**2. Pain statement:**
"[Problem] is killing [goal]"
- "Perfectionism is killing your productivity"

**3. Struggle acknowledgment:**
"Struggling with [specific issue]?"
- "Struggling to find clients who pay what you're worth?"

**4. Frustration naming:**
"The frustrating truth about [problem]"
- "The frustrating truth about 'passive income'"

### Problem Specificity Levels

**Too vague:**
- "Having trouble?"
- "Need help?"

**Good:**
- "Struggling with sales?"
- "Content not converting?"

**Very specific (often best):**
- "Spending 3 hours on emails that get no replies?"
- "Your 'viral' post got 10 likes from other creators?"

### Problem + Solution Pattern
Best hooks name problem, then promise solution:
- "Drowning in tasks? Here's the simple filter I use:"
- "Clients ghosting you? This changed everything:"

### When to Skip
- Content is aspirational/inspirational (not problem-focused)
- Problem would be offensive or insensitive
- Audience doesn't identify with having a "problem"

---

## Commandment 6: Confidence and Conviction

### Principle
Use strong, assertive language; eliminate hedge words

### Why It Works
- Confidence is persuasive
- Certainty reduces decision friction
- Hedge words signal doubt
- Reader wants decisive guidance, not maybes

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Have I eliminated hedge words (maybe, might, could, possibly)?
- [ ] Do I speak in absolutes when accurate?
- [ ] Is the language assertive, not tentative?
- [ ] Would I say this with confidence to a friend?

### Examples

**❌ Hedging/uncertain:**
- "This might help you grow faster"
- "Possibly the best approach"
- "Could be useful for scaling"
- "I think maybe this works"

**✅ Confident/convicted:**
- "This is how to grow faster"
- "The best approach for scaling"
- "Use this for breakthrough results"
- "This works. Here's why:"

### Hedge Words to Eliminate

**Remove these:**
- Maybe, might, could, possibly, probably, perhaps
- I think, I believe, in my opinion (when unnecessary)
- Sort of, kind of, somewhat, fairly
- Try to, attempt to (just say "do")

**Replace with:**
- Is, will, does, works
- This is how, here's why, the truth is
- Simply, just, exactly

### Conviction Techniques

**1. Speak in absolutes (when accurate):**
- Not: "This could increase revenue"
- But: "This increases revenue"

**2. Use declarative statements:**
- Not: "I think hustle culture might not work"
- But: "Hustle culture doesn't work. Here's what does:"

**3. Command/imperative voice:**
- Not: "You might want to try..."
- But: "Do this:"

**4. Remove qualifiers:**
- Not: "This is a relatively simple approach"
- But: "This is simple"

### When to Add Nuance
- Legal/medical topics requiring disclaimers
- Complex topics needing context
- When absolute claim would be dishonest

### Confidence ≠ Arrogance
**Confident:** "This is the system that works"
**Arrogant:** "This is the only system that works, everyone else is wrong"

---

## Commandment 7: Aesthetics

### Principle
Ensure visual appeal and readability

### Why It Works
- Visual processing happens before reading
- Clean formatting signals quality
- Scannable structure invites reading
- Wall of text triggers avoidance

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Is the hook visually clean?
- [ ] Are line breaks in the right places?
- [ ] Does it look easy to read at a glance?
- [ ] Would I stop scrolling based on how this looks?

### Examples

**❌ Poor aesthetics:**
```
I've spent 10 years building businesses and I've learned so much about what works and what doesn't work and I want to share the top 7 strategies that actually made a difference in our growth journey.
```
(Wall of text, no breaks, one sentence)

**✅ Good aesthetics:**
```
10 years building businesses.

Here are the 7 strategies that actually worked:
```
(Short lines, clear breaks, scannable)

### Formatting Rules

**For Social Media Hooks (X, LinkedIn, Facebook):**

1. **First line must be short** (5-12 words ideal)
2. **Use line breaks between sentences**
3. **Max 3 sentences for hook**
4. **Avoid ALL CAPS** (except strategic emphasis)
5. **Use emojis sparingly** (1-2 max, if at all)

**For Newsletter Subject Lines:**

1. **35-50 characters ideal** (mobile preview)
2. **No line breaks** (won't work in subject lines)
3. **Clear even when truncated**

**For Headlines:**

1. **One line when possible**
2. **Use title case or sentence case consistently**
3. **Avoid punctuation clusters** (!!!, ???)

### Visual Hierarchy

**Good pattern:**
```
[Short hook line]

[Context sentence]

[Promise/benefit]
```

**Bad pattern:**
```
[Everything crammed together without breaks and no visual hierarchy making it hard to scan or know where to focus attention]
```

### Whitespace Matters
More whitespace = easier to read = higher engagement

**Compare:**

Cramped:
```
10 years consulting. 5 startups. 150 clients. Here's what worked:
```

Spacious:
```
10 years consulting.
5 startups.
150 clients.

Here's what worked:
```

The spacious version performs better on social media.

### Platform-Specific Aesthetics

**X/Twitter:**
- Very short first line (hook)
- Generous line breaks
- Emoji at end of thread signal (🧵)

**LinkedIn:**
- First 2 lines show in feed (must work standalone)
- Professional formatting
- Line breaks for readability

**Facebook:**
- Can be denser (platform shows more)
- Questions work well
- Image + text combo ideal

### When to Skip
Subject lines and contexts where formatting doesn't display (plain text email, etc.)

---

## Commandment 8: Potential Benefit

### Principle
Clearly state what the reader will gain

### Why It Works
- Answers "What's in it for me?" immediately
- Reduces uncertainty about value
- Benefit > Feature (people care about outcomes)
- Clear ROI compels click

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Is the benefit crystal clear?
- [ ] Does it focus on outcome, not just process?
- [ ] Can reader visualize their life after?
- [ ] Is benefit specific and tangible?

### Examples

**❌ Unclear/no benefit:**
- "Things about productivity"
- "Business information"
- "Growth strategies"

**✅ Clear benefit:**
- "How to cut your workweek by 20 hours"
- "The system that ended our sales slump forever"
- "7 tools that gave me 10 hours back per week"

### Benefit Types

**1. Time saved:**
- "Save 100 hours of research"
- "Cut planning time in half"

**2. Money saved/earned:**
- "Save $12,000/year"
- "How I earn $30K/month with 8 clients"

**3. Problem solved:**
- "End the feast-or-famine cycle"
- "Finally get consistent leads"

**4. Outcome achieved:**
- "Clients who actually pay on time"
- "From hating sales to closing deals confidently"

**5. Stress reduced:**
- "Stop feeling overwhelmed"
- "The guilt-free approach to growth"

**6. Transformation:**
- "From burned out to thriving"
- "Struggling creator to full-time income"

### Feature → Benefit Translation

**Feature:** "Automated email sequences"
**Benefit:** "Wake up to new sales without lifting a finger"

**Feature:** "Small group coaching"
**Benefit:** "Get help the moment you're stuck"

**Feature:** "Flexible schedule"
**Benefit:** "Work when you want, not when you have to"

### Specificity Levels

**Vague benefit:**
- "Better results"
- "Improved performance"
- "More success"

**Specific benefit:**
- "2x your close rate in 6 months"
- "From constant hustle to 4-hour workdays"
- "6-figure income with no employees"

### When to Skip
- Benefit is so obvious it's redundant
- Content is entertaining (not utility-focused)
- Audience reads for identity/philosophy (not outcomes)

---

## Commandment 9: Social Proof

### Principle
Leverage authority, popularity, or third-party validation

### Why It Works
- Reduces risk perception
- Borrowed credibility
- "If it worked for them..." (vicarious success)
- Authority shortcut to trust

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does the hook reference credible authority?
- [ ] Are results/credentials mentioned?
- [ ] Is third-party validation included?
- [ ] Would this build trust with skeptical reader?

### Examples

**❌ No social proof:**
- "How to grow a business"
- "Tips for freelancing"
- "Marketing strategies that work"

**✅ With social proof:**
- "How Alex Hormozi grew Gym Launch to $100M"
- "The system 10,000+ freelancers use"
- "Backed by 20 years of research"

### Types of Social Proof

**1. Authority credentials:**
- "15 years in the industry"
- "Former VP at Google"
- "Built and sold 3 companies"

**2. Results achieved:**
- "Grew from 5 to 150 clients"
- "Saved $12,000 per year"
- "6 exits, none VC-backed"

**3. Scale/popularity:**
- "Used by 10,000+ businesses"
- "Trusted by 500+ agencies"
- "1.5 million downloads"

**4. Third-party validation:**
- "Featured in The New York Times"
- "Backed by Harvard research"
- "Recommended by industry leaders"

**5. Expert endorsement:**
- "Naval Ravikant's approach to wealth"
- "What Tim Ferriss says about productivity"
- "Seth Godin's method"

**6. User results:**
- "How @username went from X to Y"
- "The system that worked for [name]"

### When to Include

✅ **Include when:**
- You have relevant credentials/results
- Borrowing authority from respected figure
- Scale adds legitimacy
- Results are impressive and relevant

❌ **Skip when:**
- Would feel like bragging
- Credentials aren't relevant
- No meaningful social proof to share
- Audience doesn't care about authority

### Bragging vs Authority

**Authority (good):**
"10 years building businesses. Here's what worked:"

**Bragging (bad):**
"I'm the best entrepreneur ever. Let me tell you why:"

### Combining Social Proof Types

"How Sara Blakely (founder of Spanx) grew from selling fax machines to building a billion-dollar brand"

This combines:
- Authority (founder)
- Results (billion-dollar)
- Transformation (fax machines → empire)

---

## Commandment 10: Warning and Caution

### Principle
Create sense of urgency or importance through warning

### Why It Works
- Signals critical information
- Creates FOMO (fear of missing out)
- Implies reader might be at risk
- Urgency compels immediate action

### Checklist Questions
- [ ] Does it suggest reader might be missing something?
- [ ] Is there time sensitivity or urgency?
- [ ] Does it warn of potential pitfall?
- [ ] Would it make someone prioritize reading this?

### Examples

**❌ No urgency:**
- "Tips for marketing"
- "How businesses grow"
- "Information about sales"

**✅ Warning/urgency:**
- "Before you hire an agency, read this"
- "The mistake that costs freelancers $100K+"
- "Warning: This common practice is killing your conversions"

### Ways to Apply

**1. "Before you..." format:**
- "Before you launch, ask these 3 questions"
- "Before you quit your job, read this"

**2. "Warning:" prefix:**
- "Warning: This common pricing mistake costs you $1000s"
- "Warning: Not all automation is created equal"

**3. Time urgency:**
- "Applications close November 10"
- "This is changing fast"
- "Don't wait until [consequence]"

**4. Consequence framing:**
- "What [inaction] is costing you"
- "The hidden cost of [common practice]"

**5. Mistake prevention:**
- "The costly mistake 90% make"
- "Avoid these 3 pitfalls"
- "Don't make the mistake I did"

### Types of Urgency

**1. Time-based:**
"Applications close November 10"

**2. Consequence-based:**
"Every day without this system costs you leads"

**3. Opportunity-based:**
"Spots are filling fast"

**4. Information-based:**
"What you don't know about [topic] is hurting you"

### When to Use

✅ **Use when:**
- There IS genuine urgency
- Consequence of delay is real
- Want to move reader from awareness to action
- Information is time-sensitive

❌ **Don't use when:**
- Creating false urgency
- Content is evergreen/not time-sensitive
- Would feel manipulative
- Audience is already anxious (don't add more pressure)

### Ethical Guidelines

**Real urgency:** "Applications close November 10" ✅
**False urgency:** "Read this NOW or fail forever" ❌

**Helpful warning:** "Before you buy, here's what to know" ✅
**Manipulative:** "If you don't do this, you're a failure" ❌

---

## Scoring Your Hooks

### How to Score

For each hook variation, count how many commandments apply:

**10/10:** Probably overkill, may feel manipulative
**7-9/10:** Very strong, high engagement likely
**4-6/10:** Good, aim for this range
**2-3/10:** Weak, needs optimization
**0-1/10:** Generic, start over

### Example Scoring

**Hook:** "1.5 million businesses are using this now. Here's the surprising truth about why it works:"

Commandments applied:
1. ✅ Numbers (1.5 million)
2. ❌ Negativity bias
3. ✅ Pattern interrupt ("surprising truth")
4. ❌ Target callout
5. ❌ Problem callout
6. ✅ Confidence ("Here's")
7. ✅ Aesthetics (clean, short)
8. ✅ Benefit (will learn "why it works")
9. ✅ Social proof (scale = 1.5M)
10. ❌ Warning

**Score: 6/10** - Strong hook

### Optimization Strategy

If score is 3 or below, ask:
1. Can I add a specific number?
2. Can I name the target audience?
3. Can I make the benefit clearer?
4. Can I add urgency/warning?

Don't force all 10. Natural application > checklist completion.

## Common Combinations

Some commandments naturally pair well:

**Target + Problem:**
"Freelancers: Tired of feast-or-famine income?"

**Numbers + Social Proof:**
"10,000+ businesses use this system"

**Warning + Benefit:**
"Before you buy software (save yourself $10,000)"

**Confidence + Pattern Interrupt:**
"Forget everything you know. Here's what actually works:"

**Negativity + Solution:**
"Stop making this mistake. Do this instead:"

**Often skip:** Warning/urgency (unless B2B relevant)

### Newsletter Subject Lines
**Prioritize:** Numbers, Benefit, Curiosity (pattern interrupt), Warning
**Often skip:** Aesthetics (no formatting), Social Proof (less space)

### Facebook Hooks
**Prioritize:** Problem, Target, Benefit, Aesthetics
**Often skip:** Formal social proof (casual platform)
