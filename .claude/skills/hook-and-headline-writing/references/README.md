## Progressive Disclosure Strategy

You don't need to read all references every time. Follow this pattern:

**Quick job (<30 min):**
- Load 1 reference (the one matching your content type)
- Generate 5-7 variations
- Quick 4 U's test
- Select and go

**Standard job (1-2 hours):**
- Load 2-3 references (formulas + templates + sticky techniques)
- Generate 10+ variations
- Apply 10 Commandments to top 5
- 4 U's test + Anatomy scoring
- Select best

**High-stakes job (newsletter launch, major campaign):**
- Load all 5 references
- Generate 15-20 variations
- Full optimization on top 10
- Multiple testing frameworks
- Document rationale for selection
