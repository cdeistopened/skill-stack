# Podcast Cold Open Creator - Hybrid Method

## Purpose

Create 25-35 second cold opens that drop listeners into a specific moment, character, or conflict that encapsulates the episode's core themes. You are doing the work of a **scene selector** (finding the right moment) combined with a **film editor** (rearranging clips for dramatic impact).

**Core Philosophy:** The cold open is not a summary or a trailer. It's a psychological hook that makes listeners feel like they're stepping into the middle of an important conversation or revelation. They should finish the cold open asking "How did we get here?" and "What happens next?"

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create cold opens for podcast episodes
- Hook listeners in the first 25-35 seconds
- Find the scene/moment that best represents the episode
- Rearrange existing transcript clips to maximize tension and curiosity
- Create a sense of "you're already late to this conversation"


---

## The Fundamental Constraint

**You have ONLY TWO tools:**
1. **CUTTING** — Delete portions of what was said (or what wasn't said)
2. **REARRANGING** — Change the order clips appear (non-chronological)

**You CANNOT:**
- Add words that weren't spoken
- Paraphrase or reword
- Create new dialogue
- Add voiceover or narration
- Change the meaning of what was said

**The Art:** Like a documentary editor selecting and sequencing pre-shot footage to tell a different story than the chronological one that actually happened.

## The Descript Elements: What Makes a Cold Open Work

### 1. The Scene
Find the exact right moment—something small that encapsulates the big themes. Something specific that also gestures toward the general.

**Questions to ask:**
- What moment in this episode keeps bringing me back?
- What's an anecdote or revelation that made me lean in?
- Is there a conflict, realization, or shift happening?
- What's an inflection point where something changed?

### 2. The Character
Get them on the page in ACTION, not passively described.

**In a podcast context, this means:**
- Start with the guest (or host) doing or revealing something specific
- Don't introduce them abstractly ("Dr. Amy Moore is a psychologist...")
- Show them in the middle of something that matters

### 3. The Stakes
Make us understand what's at stake for the character or listener.

**Examples of stakes:**
- "Her next paycheck depends on it"
- "These kids don't have the tools to succeed"
- "If we don't understand this, we'll keep making the same mistake"
- "This changed everything about how I parent"

### 4. The Conflict/Shift
Find moments of friction, surprise, or expectation-violation.

**Look for:**
- Contradiction hooks (what we think vs. what's true)
- Surprising revelations (we expected one thing, got another)
- Moments of struggle or realization
- Points where the character's perspective changed

### 5. The Setup/Tease
End by gesturing toward what's to come without giving it away.

**The tease should:**
- Leave a question unanswered
- Hint at a bigger pattern or insight
- Make the listener curious about how we got here
- Promise there's more to understand

## The Workflow: 4 Steps

### Step 1: Identify Your Scene
Before selecting clips, identify which moment or sequence best encapsulates the episode.

**Scan the transcript for:**

**Inflection Points** (moments of shift):
- "I was diagnosed with ADHD..."
- "Then everything changed..."
- "I realized I was doing it wrong..."

**Vulnerability Moments** (personal stakes):
- "I failed college twice..."
- "My kid couldn't spell his own name..."
- "I was terrified..."

**Contradiction Moments** (what we think vs. reality):
- "We thought he was defiant, but actually..."
- "Most people believe X, but the research shows..."
- "It looks like they're ignoring you, but really..."

**Surprising Insights** (research or data):
- "5,000 studies showed that..."
- "The weakest skill wasn't attention, it was..."
- "What nobody talks about is..."

**Character in Action** (doing, not describing):
- "I kept drawing myself into the couch cushions..."
- "She got an A in college as a ninth grader..."
- "I had to make his bucket so big..."

Choose ONE scene that:
- Contains a character (ideally the guest)
- Shows them doing or revealing something
- Has stakes attached
- Hints at a bigger theme
- Creates a natural question or gap

### Step 2: Extract Clips from That Scene
Now that you know your scene, find all the verbatim clips within and around it.

**Pull clips that show:**
1. **The setup** — Where is this character? What are they in the middle of?
2. **The character** — Who are they? What are they struggling with or realizing?
3. **The conflict** — What's the tension or contradiction?
4. **The shift** — What changed or what's surprising?
5. **The tease** — What question does this leave unanswered?

**Document each clip with:**
- Speaker name
- Exact timestamp
- Verbatim quote
- Approximate duration (~3-8 seconds each)

### Step 3: Arrange for Narrative Arc (Not Chronological Order)
Now rearrange these clips to tell a more dramatic story than the original sequence.

**The Descript Arc Structure:**
1. **Scene/Setup** (2-3 sec) — Drop us into the moment
2. **Character** (3-5 sec) — Who is this person? Show them in action
3. **Conflict/Shift** (4-6 sec) — What's the tension or surprise?
4. **Stakes** (2-3 sec) — Why does this matter?
5. **Tease** (2-3 sec) — What question are we left with? [CUT mid-thought or mid-revelation]

**Key principle:** You are NOT arranging chronologically. You are arranging for maximum emotional/intellectual impact.

**Example false chronology:**
- Original order in episode: Background → Struggle → Revelation → Action
- Cold open order: Revelation → Struggle → Background → Action (cuts before answer)

### Step 4: Quality Control Against the 5 Tests

**The Stranger Test**
- Would someone with zero context be intrigued?
- Does it create questions rather than provide answers?

**The Itch Test**
- Does it create an unbearable need to know more?
- Would you feel frustrated if the episode ended here?

**The Stakes Test**
- Is it clear why this matters?
- Does the listener care about the character or outcome?

**The Tease Test**
- Does it hint at something without giving it away?
- Are we left wondering "how?" or "what next?"

**The Emotion Test**
- Does the listener feel something in the first 5 seconds?
- Is the emotional arc clear?

Pass at least 4 out of 5 = good cold open.

## Technical Rules

### Timing
- **Total length**: 25-35 seconds
- **Individual clips**: 3-8 seconds each (no clip under 2 seconds, no clip over 10 seconds)
- **No more than 5-6 clips** (too many quick cuts = disorienting)

### Audio Quality
- **Complete thoughts only** — Even if cut mid-sentence, must be processable
- **Preserve natural speech flow** — Don't create choppy, robotic exchanges
- **Use speaker changes for rhythm** — Back-and-forth creates momentum
- **End on an open question or incomplete thought** — Maximum curiosity

### The Cliffhanger (Non-Negotiable)
Every cold open MUST end with an unresolved moment. This cliffhanger must be 100% verbatim from the transcript.

**Types of cliffhangers:**
- **Unfinished statement**: "So what we do instead is..." [CUT]
- **Unfinished question**: "And the real reason was..." [CUT]
- **Shocking statement with no explanation**: "We were looking at the wrong thing entirely..." [CUT]
- **Promise of revelation**: "But there's one thing nobody talks about..." [CUT]

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ The Scene Selection Trap
**Mistake**: Picking a "important" moment that doesn't actually encapsulate the episode or create curiosity
**Fix**: Ask "Would a stranger care about this?" Pick moments with built-in drama, conflict, or surprise

### ❌ The Chronological Edit
**Mistake**: Arranging clips in the order they appeared in the episode
**Fix**: Deliberately rearrange to tell a different, more dramatic story. Start with the end result, jump to the problem, tease the solution

### ❌ The Exposition Trap
**Mistake**: Explaining who the guest is or why they're talking
**Fix**: Drop listeners in the middle. Let them figure out the context through what's being said

### ❌ The Over-Explanation
**Mistake**: Including too many clips or clips that resolve the tension
**Fix**: Cut ruthlessly. The cold open is not the full story—it's a teaser

### ❌ The Resolution Error
**Mistake**: Ending with the answer or solution revealed
**Fix**: End with a question, a shift, a surprise—something that makes listeners want more

### ❌ The Choppy Cut
**Mistake**: Cutting mid-word or creating unnatural pauses that make the audio feel edited
**Fix**: Cut at natural sentence breaks or at places where the speaker naturally paused

## Key Insight

**A cold open is not:**
- A summary of the episode
- A movie trailer
- An explanation of what's to come
- A highlight reel

**A cold open IS:**
- A scene that encapsulates the episode's themes
- A moment that creates immediate curiosity
- A psychological hook that makes NOT listening feel like a mistake
- An invitation into the middle of something important

If listeners finish your cold open thinking "I need to hear the rest of this episode to understand what's happening," you've succeeded.
