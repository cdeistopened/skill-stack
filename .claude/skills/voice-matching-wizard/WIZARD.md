# Voice Matching Wizard

*A conversation to capture your voice in about 15 minutes.*

---

## Welcome

I'll help you create a voice skill—a file that captures the patterns, rhythms, and sensibilities of your writing (or a style you want to emulate).

The result: a `voice-[name].skill.md` you can use across all your content.

---

## First Question

**What brings you here today?**

Please share which scenario best describes you:

**A) "I have samples of my own writing I want to codify."**
You've written things you're proud of. You want AI to match your voice consistently.

**B) "I want to emulate a style I admire."**
You have a publication, author, or brand voice you want to learn from.

**C) "I'm discovering my voice."**
You're not sure what your voice is yet. You want to find it.

*Type A, B, or C to continue.*

---

## Path A: Your Own Voice

Great. Let's capture what makes your writing yours.

**Share 2-3 writing samples** that represent your authentic voice. These should be:
- At least 500 words each
- Writing you're proud of
- Representative of how you want to sound

Paste your first sample below, or tell me where to find it.

---

## Path B: Emulation

You want to learn from another voice. That's how most writers develop—through absorption and adaptation.

**Important:** The goal isn't imitation. It's understanding the *patterns* that create a distinctive effect, so you can make them your own.

**Tell me about the voice you admire:**
- Who is it? (Author, publication, brand)
- What specifically draws you to their style?
- Do you have samples you can share?

If the writer is well-known (Didion, Hemingway, The Economist), I may already know their patterns. For lesser-known voices or specific publications, samples help.

---

## Path C: Discovery

Finding your voice means understanding how you naturally communicate when you're not performing.

Let me ask you a few questions:

1. **When you explain something to a friend, how do you do it?**
   - Stories and examples?
   - Logical arguments?
   - Jokes?
   - Questions?

2. **What writers do you actually read?**
   Not who you think you should—who do you return to?

3. **How long are your natural sentences?**
   Short and punchy? Long and flowing? Both?

4. **How do you feel about jargon?**

5. **What's your relationship with your reader?**
   Peer? Mentor? Curious explorer?

After you answer, I'll help you identify pieces you've written that might capture your authentic voice.

## Sample Analysis

*[After samples are provided]*

Looking at your writing, I notice these patterns:

### Sentence Architecture
- [Average length observation]
- [Variation patterns]
- [Signature structures]

### Word Choice
- [Vocabulary level]
- [Favorite words/phrases]
- [What you avoid]

### Tone & Attitude
- [Emotional register]
- [Reader relationship]
- [Humor style]

### Distinctive Moves
- [Opening patterns]
- [Transitions]
- [Closing patterns]
- [What makes this voice recognizable]

**Does this capture your voice?** What would you adjust?

## Voice Spectrum

Based on our conversation, let's place your voice on these scales:

```
Formal ←――1――2――3――4――5――→ Casual         [  ]
Expert ←――1――2――3――4――5――→ Peer           [  ]
Serious ←―1――2――3――4――5――→ Playful        [  ]
Reserved ←1――2――3――4――5――→ Opinionated    [  ]
Abstract ←1――2――3――4――5――→ Concrete       [  ]
```

Do these ratings feel accurate? Adjust where needed.

## Generating Your Voice Skill

Based on everything we've discussed, I'm creating `voice-[name].skill.md`.

This file contains:
- Your voice description
- Spectrum ratings
- Core characteristics
- Example patterns
- Quality checklist
- Anti-patterns to avoid

**To use this skill:**
1. Save it to `.claude/skills/voice-[name]/SKILL.md`
2. Reference it when writing: "Use the voice-[name] skill"
3. Combine with `anti-ai-writing` for humanized output

---

## What's Next?

Your voice skill works best when combined with:

- **anti-ai-writing** — Removes generic AI patterns
- **ghostwriter** — For long-form pieces
- **social-content-creation** — For platform-specific posts
- **hook-and-headline-writing** — For attention-grabbing openers

Would you like help with any of these?

---

## Maintenance

Your voice evolves. Revisit this skill:
- When something feels off
- When you've had a breakthrough in your writing
- Quarterly, as a check-in

The goal isn't to freeze your voice—it's to have a reliable starting point that grows with you.

*One conversation. One file. Consistent voice across everything.*
