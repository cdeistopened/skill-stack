# Voice Matching Wizard

Create a voice skill that captures the patterns, rhythms, and sensibilities of any writing style.

## Quick Start

1. Open Claude Desktop or Claude.ai
2. Upload this folder (or the SKILL.md file)
3. Say: "I want to create a voice skill"
4. Follow the wizard prompts

## What's Inside

```
voice-matching-wizard/
├── SKILL.md           # The complete analysis framework
├── WIZARD.md          # Conversational guide for setup
├── README.md          # This file
├── references/
│   └── example-voice-skill.md   # What the output looks like
└── templates/
    └── voice-skill.template.md  # Blank template for your voice
```

## Three Paths

**A) Your own voice** — Codify your existing writing style
**B) Emulate a style** — Learn from a voice you admire
**C) Discover your voice** — Find it through guided questions

## What You'll Need

- 2-5 writing samples (500+ words each)
- 15-20 minutes
- Samples should be writing you're proud of

## What You'll Get

A working `voice-[name].skill.md` file containing:
- Voice description and spectrum ratings
- Core characteristics across 6 dimensions
- Signature patterns with examples
- Quality checklist
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Usage

Once created, combine your voice skill with:
- **anti-ai-writing** — Always. Removes generic AI patterns.
- **ghostwriter** — For long-form content
- **social-content-creation** — For platform-specific posts

## Tips

- More samples = better results
- Analyze similar content types together (newsletters with newsletters)
- Look for unconscious patterns the writer may not know they have
- Update the skill as your voice evolves
