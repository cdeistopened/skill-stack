# Editing Guidelines for Transcript Polishing

## Aggressive Polishing Strategy

**Target Reduction**: 25-35% of original length while maintaining 100% fidelity to meaning.

## What TO Edit (Aggressively)

### 1. Filler Words

Remove ALL instances unless part of signature style or specific emphasis:
- "um," "uh," "you know," "like," "so," "well," "I mean," "you know what I mean"

**Before**: "So, um, I think that, you know, what we really need to, uh, focus on is, like, making sure that kids are, you know, getting what they need."

**After**: "What we really need to focus on is making sure that kids are getting what they need."

### 2. False Starts & Restarts

Consolidate aggressively to the final, clearest version:

**Before**: "The thing is, well, what I mean is, the problem with education today is that we're not, I mean, the real issue is standardization."

**After**: "The real issue with education today is standardization."

### 3. Redundant Explanations

If the speaker says the same thing multiple ways, pick the clearest version:

**Before**: "It was really big. Like, it was huge. I mean, it was massive. The impact was enormous."

**After**: "The impact was enormous."

### 4. Verbal Hedging

Remove unnecessary qualifiers when used excessively (keep when they add nuance):

Remove: "kind of," "sort of," "a little bit," "I think," "probably," "maybe"

**Before**: "I think we kind of need to probably focus more on this"

**After**: "We need to focus more on this"

### 5. Conversational Detours

Cut tangents that don't serve the main narrative:

**Before (120 words)**: "When I said I was going to join Teach for America—and my mom, she went to college herself, she's really into education, but she had different ideas about what I should do—as an example, when I told her, my mother was like, fricking, not, you're not going to go teach. We didn't send you to an Ivy League college—which was Brown, by the way, I went to Brown—to go teach in some public school. She had all these expectations about what I should be doing with my degree."

**After (35 words)**: "When I said I was going to join Teach for America, my mother was like, 'You're not going to go teach. We didn't send you to an Ivy League college to go teach public school.'"

### 6. Awkward Grammar

Fix:
- Subject-verb disagreement
- Run-on sentences
- Incomplete thoughts
- Unclear pronoun references

### 7. Repetitive Examples

If speaker gives 5 examples of the same point, keep the 1-2 strongest.

### 8. Unclear References

Add minimal clarity to pronouns and vague references:

**Before**: "And then he told them that it was important."

**After**: "And then [the principal] told them that it was important."

Use brackets sparingly—only when essential for clarity.

## What NOT TO Edit

### 1. Unique Voice

Preserve the speaker's natural rhythm and style.

**Keep**: "That really bugged the crap out of me. I wanted to do something that was going to fix that."

Don't sanitize authentic expressions that show personality.

### 2. Key Quotes

Maintain exact wording of powerful statements and memorable phrases.

### 3. Emotional Moments

Keep authentic vulnerability and passion—these are often the most compelling parts.

### 4. Specialized Language

Retain industry-specific terminology and technical language.

### 5. Cultural References

Preserve personality-revealing details and references.

### 6. Conversational Flow

Maintain natural dialogue patterns and back-and-forth exchanges.

## Aggressive vs. Moderate Polishing Examples

### Example 1: Filler Removal

**Raw (63 words)**:
"So, um, I think that, you know, what we really need to, uh, focus on is, like, making sure that kids are, you know, getting what they need. And I mean, it's really important that we, like, pay attention to, um, you know, their individual needs and stuff. Because, like, every kid is different, right?"

**Moderate Polish (42 words)**:
"I think what we really need to focus on is making sure that kids are getting what they need. And it's really important that we pay attention to their individual needs. Because every kid is different."

**Aggressive Polish (20 words)**:
"We need to focus on making sure kids get what they need. We must pay attention to their individual needs because every kid is different."

### Example 2: Consolidating Redundancy

**Raw (87 words)**:
"I was really frustrated. Like, I was super annoyed. I mean, it really bothered me. It bugged the crap out of me, you know? And I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to fix it. I mean, I really felt like I needed to change this situation. So I decided I was going to, you know, take action and do something that would address this problem."

**Moderate Polish (48 words)**:
"I was really frustrated. It bugged the crap out of me. And I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to fix it. I felt like I needed to change this situation. So I decided I was going to take action."

**Aggressive Polish (16 words)**:
"That really bugged the crap out of me. I wanted to do something that was going to fix that."

## Length Reduction Strategies

To achieve 25-35% reduction:

1. Remove ALL filler words (not just excessive ones)
2. Consolidate every redundant explanation to single clearest statement
3. Combine similar points made at different times into one place
4. Eliminate ALL tangents that don't serve main narrative
5. Condense verbose examples to their essential core
6. Remove verbal hedging aggressively
7. Tighten sentence structure while preserving voice

## Always Maintain (100% Fidelity)

Even with aggressive editing, always preserve:
- All major insights and takeaways
- Compelling stories and anecdotes (told more concisely)
- Emotional peaks and revelations
- Practical advice and frameworks
- Speaker's authentic voice and personality
- The actual words used (never paraphrase or change meaning)

## Quality Check Questions

Before finalizing:
1. Did I reduce length by 25-35%?
2. Are all filler words removed?
3. Did I preserve the speaker's unique voice?
4. Are key insights and stories intact?
5. Did I change any meanings or add ideas not in the original?
6. Would the speaker recognize and approve this as what they said?

If you answer "no" to #3-6, revise before completing.
