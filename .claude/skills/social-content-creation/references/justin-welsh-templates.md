**Objective:** To generate high-quality, authentic LinkedIn posts by strategically applying the frameworks within this swipe file.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Avoid First-Match Bias:** Do not default to the first template that seems to fit. Read and consider *all* frameworks in this document to find the optimal match for the content's core message and strategic goal.
2.  **Analyze, Then Select:** Treat template selection as a distinct step.
    *   First, deeply understand the core concept, insight, or story you want to communicate.
    *   Second, review the available frameworks, evaluating them against the concept.
    *   Third, select the framework that most powerfully amplifies the message.
3.  **Prioritize Authenticity:** The framework is a skeleton. The value comes from fleshing it out with the authentic voice, specific details, and unique perspective of your brand.
4.  **Adapt and Combine:** Don't be afraid to adapt a framework or combine elements from different frameworks if it serves the message better. The goal is an effective post, not rigid adherence to a template.
