# How to Use This Guide (Agent Instructions)

**Objective:** To generate high-quality, authentic LinkedIn posts by strategically applying the frameworks within this swipe file.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Avoid First-Match Bias:** Do not default to the first template that seems to fit. Read and consider *all* frameworks in this document to find the optimal match for the content's core message and strategic goal.
2.  **Analyze, Then Select:** Treat template selection as a distinct step.
    *   First, deeply understand the core concept, insight, or story you want to communicate.
    *   Second, review the available frameworks, evaluating them against the concept.
    *   Third, select the framework that most powerfully amplifies the message.
3.  **Prioritize Authenticity:** The framework is a skeleton. The value comes from fleshing it out with the authentic voice, specific details, and unique perspective of your brand.
4.  **Adapt and Combine:** Don't be afraid to adapt a framework or combine elements from different frameworks if it serves the message better. The goal is an effective post, not rigid adherence to a template.

# LinkedIn Content Frameworks

## 1. The "Agree or Disagree" Post

### Description

This strategy works by asking people to participate with a yes/no response while layering it with a personal story that adds emotional depth and relatability.

### Example

```
A lousy job with a good boss is better than a good job with a lousy boss.

Agree?

I was talking to a friend this weekend and they told me about this terrible experience they had at work.

They said to me, "My boss made a mistake on a project we were working on, and instead of owning his mistake, he said it was my fault. I sat through that meeting feeling shocked and disappointed. When we left the meeting, he told me, 'You are a good sport.' I knew I needed to start planning my exit strategy. I love my job, but I can't trust my boss."

It's demotivating being under a bad manager. I've had some bad bosses and it really makes a huge difference on "whom you work with" vs "what you work on" each day. I think a lousy job with a good boss and great co-workers is better than a good job with a lousy boss or co-workers who don't have your back.

I'm curious... what do you think...? Comment below.

```

### Template

```
{{Make a statement}}

Agree or disagree...? Leave it in the comments.

I was talking to a friend this weekend and they told me about this terrible experience they had at work.

They said to me, "{{share the terrible experience}}"

Here's what I've come to learn over the years...

{{insight and a good perspective on life… OR … you can also insert a quote if you can't come up with something}}

I'm curious...what do you think...?

Comment below.

```

### How It Works

- Opens with a controversial or thought-provoking statement that demands a position
- Invites engagement with a simple agree/disagree prompt
- Shares a relatable personal story that illustrates the statement
- Provides your perspective or insight on the issue
- Ends with an explicit call to action for comments

## 2. The "Before and After" Post

### Description

This strategy showcases transformation and results, which is inherently engaging. People love to see evidence of improvement and positive change, especially when it's visual.

### Example

```
[Image showing Before/After transformation]

What does your LinkedIn profile photo say about you?

First impressions matter.

```

### Template

```
[Image showing Before/After transformation]

{{Brief caption explaining the transformation}}

{{Insight about why this matters}}

```

### How It Works

- Uses before/after visuals to demonstrate transformation
- Keeps text minimal to let the images tell the story
- Provides a brief insight about why the transformation matters
- Implicitly invites viewers to consider their own situation

## 3. The "Contrarian Video" Post

### Description

This strategy works by challenging conventional wisdom with proof that something still works despite popular opinion saying otherwise.

### Example

```
Who says cold email doesn't work...?!

Ask me anything about cold email and I'll answer it in the comments.

[Video showing cold email results]

```

### Template

```
Who's to say {{XXX}} doesn't work...?!

Ask me anything about {{XXX}} and I'll answer it in the comments.

Here's a great evergreen strategy that works well. It's called the {{XXX}} strategy.

It works because {{XXX}}

Some quick tips when deploying this strategy:
- Tip 1
- Tip 2
- Tip 3
- Tip 4
- Tip 5

#hashtags

P.S. If you want to swipe some of my best {{XXX}} strategies, then comment "yes, please" below.

```

### How It Works

- Challenges a common belief with a provocative question
- Uses video to provide evidence that contradicts conventional wisdom
- Invites engagement through a specific prompt (ask me anything)
- Provides immediate value with quick tips
- Includes a P.S. that creates additional engagement opportunity

## 4. The "Work Vs Personal Life" Post

### Description

This strategy taps into the universal struggle of work-life balance, creating instant relatability and engagement.

### Example

```
Are you a workaholic and have kids?

If so, this video is for you.

[Video content]

```

### Template

```
Are you a {{XXX}} and struggle with {{XXX}}? Then this is for you.

{{Tell story}}

Comment below if you can relate and tag those you love that need to hear this message.

```

### How It Works

- Targets a specific audience with a direct question
- Addresses a common struggle most professionals face
- Provides personal stories or actionable advice
- Explicitly asks for comments and tags, expanding reach

## 5. The "Free Advertising" Post

### Description

This strategy works because everyone wants to promote their business. When you give them permission to be promotional, people will jump at the opportunity.

### Example

```
Go ahead -> Advertise on this post. Leave ONE sentence on who you help and how you help in the comments. It's your elevator pitch.

1000s of people will see it.

RULES:
You have to keep to 1 sentence.

HOW TO HELP:
Everyone will give you feedback or ideas on your 1-sentence pitch.

ARE YOU STUCK…?
If you are stuck, say "I'm stuck" and I'll look at your profile and make some suggestions.

```

### Template

```
Go ahead -> Advertise on this post. Leave ONE sentence on who you help and how you help in the comments. It's your elevator pitch.

1000s of people will see it.

RULES:
You have to keep to 1 sentence.

HOW TO HELP:
Everyone will give you feedback or ideas on your 1-sentence pitch.

ARE YOU STUCK…?
If you are stuck, say "I'm stuck" and I'll look at your profile and make some suggestions.

```

### How It Works

- Gives permission for self-promotion (normally discouraged)
- Creates clear constraints (one sentence only)
- Offers value (feedback and visibility)
- Creates an additional engagement hook for those who are "stuck"
- Leverages others' desire for visibility

## 6. The "Failure" Post

### Description

Everyone loves an underdog story. Share your failures and how you overcame them to create a compelling narrative that resonates with readers.

### Example

```
I have received enough rejection letters and emails that I could wallpaper my entire house. (And my house is 15,000 square feet) (just go with it)

(Give or take 14,000 square feet)

I have been rejected by schools.
I've lost out on jobs.
I've lost a few bids.
I've lost a boyfriend or two. (Big mistake. Yuge)

I've been rejected on a boat, and even once by a goat. Rejected wearing a faux fur hat and by some seedy slimy rat. (True story) I've been rejected in a house and picked over for mouse.

I should have given up 32,741 times. (Precisely)
(But) that was never, ever an option.
Ever.

So get up. Wipe the dust off you. (See what I did there) and go get 'em tiger.
It's your turn!

Now go and have the best week in the history of the entire world.
Just saying.

```

### Template

```
I have failed {{XXX}} times.

Here's a list of some of my biggest failures:
- Failure 1
- Failure 2
- Failure 3
- Failure 4
- Failure 5
- Failure 6
- Failure 7
- Failure 8

But what was never an option, was to give-up.
Ever.

So get up.
Wipe the dust off you.
And go get your dream!

```

### How It Works

- Creates vulnerability through admission of failures
- Uses humor to make the message more palatable
- Builds to an inspirational conclusion
- Encourages readers through your personal resilience story
- Leverages storytelling to create emotional connection

## 7. The "Best Boss" Post

### Description

If you tell a touching story of how a boss treated you or someone you know well, you'll tap on nerves everyone can relate to.

### Example

```
I had a boss I do just about anything for (even today) because of what he did for me.

I was hired by a lawn maintenance company one summer while at college....

[Story about what the boss did]

This is how you get loyal employees.

You listen to what they need, then you find ways to get it to them.

Comment or tag your boss if they are brilliant at what they do.

```

### Template

```
I had a boss I do just about anything for (even today) because of what he/she did for me.

I was hired at {{XXX}} to do {{XXX}}

This {{terrible thing}} happened to me.

My boss found out about it.

They {{describe how they fixed the problem}}.

This is how you get loyal employees.

You listen to what they need, then you find ways to get it to them.

Comment or tag your boss if they are brilliant at what they do.

#HR

```

### How It Works

- Tells a personal story with emotional impact
- Highlights positive leadership qualities
- Provides a clear lesson about management/leadership
- Encourages tagging and commenting about readers' own experiences
- Creates emotional resonance through storytelling

## 8. The "Run a Poll" Post

### Description

This works because everyone likes to give their opinion. Using images and asking people to select preferences creates engaging, participatory content.

### Example

```
Which profile photo do you think scored better ... ? A or B ... ? Put your answer in the comments, then read below.

[Images of two different profile photos]

```

### Template

```
Which of these {{XXX}} do you prefer? I personally think that {{XXX}}, but I am interested to hear your answers. Give me your reasoning in the comments!!!

```

### How It Works

- Creates easy engagement with a simple question
- Uses visuals to increase post appeal
- Creates curiosity (people want to know which one performed better)
- Explicitly asks for comments with reasoning, deepening engagement
- Offers your opinion, inviting agreement or disagreement

## 9. "Which Would You Rather" Post

### Description

Similar to a poll, this type of post asks people to choose between options and explain their reasoning, driving deeper engagement.

### Example

```
Which would you prefer?

A) A website that gets 100,000 visits per month and converts at 0.05% to SQLs.
or
B) A website that gets 10,000 visits per month and converts at 5% to SQLs?

Tell us which is better and why in the comments.

```

### Template

```
What would you do {{describe the situation they might be in}}?

Would you rather:
A. {{example 1}}
OR
B. {{example 2}}

Pros and Cons to both. Leave your answer and reason why in the comments!

```

### How It Works

- Presents a clear choice between two options
- Encourages analytical thinking
- Explicitly asks for reasoning, which drives deeper comments
- Creates a natural discussion between people with different preferences
- Often reveals interesting insights about your audience's priorities

## 10. The "What Impresses You vs Doesn't Impress You" Post

### Description

Sharing a post of good behavior vs bad behavior and asking people if they agree or not is powerful and will trend.

### Example

```
I have met & worked with a lot of leaders over the last 10 years. The ONLY thing that impresses me when I meet a leader is how they treat their people.

I am not impressed by how much you make.
I am not impressed by your job title.
I am not impressed by your ambitious KPIs.
I am not impressed by your fancy office.
I am not impressed by your entrepreneur network.

What impresses me is when I see a leader who puts their team first.
I am impressed by leaders who have staff who work for them for 10+ years.
You know they have great leaders because no one would stay at a company for 10+ years anymore without great leaders.

People do business with people.
Focusing on growing your people is how you focus on the long game. Leaders who show they continue to grow their people even after they've moved on from their company is a sign of a great leader. Too many leaders don't celebrate their employee alumni enough.

Treating people well is how you WIN in business.
The long game is always focusing on people.

Do you agree?

```

### Template

```
I have met & worked with a lot of {{XXX}} over the last {{XXX}} years. The ONLY thing that impresses me when I meet a {{XXX}} is how they {{XXX}}

I am not impressed by {{XXX}}
I am not impressed by {{XXX}}
I am not impressed by {{XXX}}
I am not impressed by {{XXX}}

What impresses me is when I see a {{XXX}} who {{XXX}}.

Do you agree?

```

### How It Works

- Creates clear contrast between superficial achievements and meaningful qualities
- Uses repetitive structure for emphasis
- Speaks to deeper values that most people share
- Ends with a clear call for agreement/disagreement
- Allows people to signal their values by agreeing

---

## 11. The "Screenshot" Post

### Description

Taking a photo or screenshot of something emotionally impactful can create an immediate connection with your audience and drive engagement.

### Example

```
[Screenshot of poem that reads differently when read top-down versus bottom-up]

Words in a different order can make a world of difference.

```

### Template

```
[Screenshot of emotionally impactful content]

{{Brief comment that highlights the significance or meaning}}

```

### How It Works

- Uses visual content to grab attention
- Shares something unexpected or thought-provoking
- Minimal text lets the screenshot tell the story
- Creates a moment of connection through shared emotion

## 12. The "Quote" Post

### Description

Quotes consistently perform well on LinkedIn. They provide wisdom or inspiration in a concise format and allow you to align yourself with respected thought leaders.

### Example

```
Most companies need a "Chief Simplification Officer" more than they need a "Chief Innovation Officer". - Dharmesh Shah

```

### Template

```
{{Quote}}
- {{Author}}

[Optional: Add your own brief thought about why this quote resonates with you]

```

### How It Works

- Borrows authority and wisdom from respected figures
- Provides valuable insight in a highly digestible format
- Creates easy engagement (people love to react to quotes)
- Can be enhanced with your own perspective or experience
- Positions you alongside thought leaders in your field

## 13. The "Movie Script" Post

### Description

This works because everyone loves dialogue and stories. Creating a conversational back-and-forth captures attention and makes complex ideas accessible.

### Example

```
MANAGER: You are late!
EMPLOYEE: It is only 9:21 am
MANAGER: Work starts at 9:00 am. I will have to write you up for this.
EMPLOYEE: But I am not usually late, but I had to take my child to daycare today because my husband couldn't this morning. I stayed late yesterday & got up early this morning to answer emails. Could you just let me off this one time?
MANAGER: We can't because this would set the wrong example that it's okay to be late.

It's time for managers to stop micromanaging their team.

If you have to do that to a person you hired, then you hired the wrong person, to begin with.

You know what happens when you to do this to an employee?
They tell themselves they are not going to work from home, or come early ever again or stay late to finish a project. They will just arrive and leave on time, but not give a S*"T anymore.

This type of indifference is what kills the culture & any business.

I think it's funny how many managers will never complain when employees go the extra mile, but they think it's okay to point out employees mistakes.

A great manager will spend 90% of their time publicly praising & inspiring their team to be their best & 10% providing private real-time constructive feedback.

A great manager will have your back & set you up for success.

Agree?

```

### Template

```
PERSON 1: {{dialogue}}
PERSON 2: {{dialogue}}
PERSON 1: {{dialogue}}
PERSON 2: {{dialogue}}

{{Tell the moral of the story}}

Do you agree…. Why or why not… leave it in the comments!

```

### How It Works

- Creates an engaging story format that's easy to follow
- Uses dialogue to illustrate common workplace situations
- Builds to a clear lesson or insight
- Addresses workplace dynamics that many people experience
- Explicitly asks for agreement or disagreement to drive comments

## 14. The "Someone Was Wronged" Post

### Description

This works because everyone hates when someone has been wronged unfairly. People naturally want to express support and share their own similar experiences.

### Example

```
Recently, I forwarded the resume of a very skilled and smart lady who had taken a 10-year career break to raise her children. The feedback I got from the interview was very disappointing.

"She seems super smart, but 10 years is a long time, we can't take that risk."

She had taken the break to be a stay-at-home mom for her three young boys.

I know this person, and she would crush anything they touched. It made me so mad to hear this.

I personally gravitate towards people who've taken a different path or who've taken employment gaps. I think those people usually have something extra to offer because of those experiences.

I also got thinking that we have a long way to come when it comes to understanding time off to raise children. Our society needs to change.

A gap in employment history should not discount someone's abilities.

All that should matter is if the candidate has the right skills and attitude to do the job.

One of my very best employees had 7-year employee gap because they ran a family SMB business for 5 years and then took care of their sick mother for 2 years. I am so glad I didn't care about that employee gap on their resume.

Take a chance on hiring people with employee gaps, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Agree?

```

### Template

```
Recently, I witnessed {{XXX}}

This is not okay.

All that should matter is {{XXX}}

Please {{XXX}}

Agree?

```

### How It Works

- Tells a story of injustice that elicits emotional responses
- Takes a moral stand that most people can agree with
- Challenges commonly-held biases or prejudices in professional settings
- Offers a more ethical alternative approach
- Ends with a question that invites support and similar stories

## 15. The "Things I've Learned Birthday" Post

### Description

This is another spin on the listicle post. Everyone loves a big list of things people have learned throughout their life or career, especially when presented as wisdom gained over time.

### Example

```
I just turned 43, so I thought I'd share 43 random tips
1) Listen ... before you talk.
2) Focus and go deep ... before you switch gears.
3) Think ... before you act.
4) Save ... before you spend.
5) Try ... before you quit.
6) Don't wear socks ... with Crocs.
7) Delete social media ... off your phone.
8) Be a forever student ... before you decide to Mentor.
9) If you want to get things done ... block the time off in your calendar.
10) If you want to be wealthy ... understand how compound interest works.
[...]

```

### Template

```
{{State major milestone}}, so I thought I'd share {{XXX}} I've learned over the last {{XXX}} years.

1. The secret to {{XXX}} is {{XXX}}.
2. Never {{XXX}} while {{XXX}} because it will {{XXX}}.
3. If you want {{XXX}} be sure to {{XXX}}, otherwise you'll get {{XXX}}.
4. Success is {{XXX}} and not {{XXX}}.
5. Here's what {{XXX}} won't tell you about {{XXX}}. Avoid {{XXX}} at all costs, so you can get {{XXX}}.

```

### How It Works

- Uses a personal milestone as a reason to share wisdom
- Presents actionable tips in an easily digestible list format
- Mixes serious advice with lighter, more humorous points
- Creates space for people to comment on which tips resonated most
- Positions you as experienced and insightful in your field

## 16. The "Things They Won't Teach You" Post

### Description

This post works well because everyone can relate to some kind of experience that didn't properly prepare them for reality. Revealing "hidden" or unconventional wisdom positions you as an insider sharing valuable secrets.

### Example

```
12 Things School Won't Teach You:
1. How to ask for raise.
2. How to cold call.
3. How to sell.
4. How to fire a person.
5. How to and when to hire.
6. How to invest your $.
7. How to stay mentally healthy.
8. How to interview and pick great candidates.
9. How to prospect for new clients without being a douche.
10. How to be grateful.
11. How to truly listen.
12.?

I need your help. ...what's number 12?
Comment it below!

```

### Template

```
{{number}} things {{XXX}} won't teach you

1.{{XXX}}
2.{{XXX}}
3.{{XXX}}
4. {{XXX}}

Any ideas for what number {{XXX}} should be??

```

### How It Works

- Challenges conventional education or training by highlighting its gaps
- Creates a list of practical, real-world skills that most people need
- Positions you as someone with insider knowledge
- Invites participation by asking for suggestions for the final item
- Appeals to people's desire for practical, applicable knowledge

## 17. The "All The Jobs I've Had" Post

### Description

This one works because people love to see the journey others have taken. It humanizes you and showcases your diverse experience while inviting others to share their own paths.

### Example

```
Don't forget where you came from. Its what makes you interesting.

Newspaper boy. Babysitter. Construction worker. Lifeguard. Swim instructor. Lawn Maintenance Worker. Shovelled dirt in Bags. Theatre Actor. Screen Actor. Waiter. Door-to-door salesperson. Telemarketer. Network Marketer. Belly Dancer. Director. Manager. CMO. COO. Entrepreneur. (ok one may be fictional...you guess)

Some jobs were terrible and some were great but each job taught me something that has stuck with me for life.

The big thing I've learned (if you are open to it), is you never know whom you will meet and how they will impact your life.

We all have our own journeys. Enjoy the ride!

P.S. List all the jobs you've had in the comments. It's fun and it takes 30 seconds to do. I always find it amazing to see all the fun stuff people have done.

I hope everyone has a brilliant weekend!

```

### Template

```
Don't forget where you've come from. Here's a list of all the jobs I've had and what I learned from each one.

1. {{XXX}}
2. {{XXX}}
3. {{XXX}}
4. {{XXX}}
5. {{XXX}}
6. {{XXX}}
7. {{XXX}}
8. {{XXX}}

Your turn.

Either list all the jobs you've had in the comments or tell me which of my job lessons was your favorite.

```

### How It Works

- Shows your diverse background and journey
- Humanizes you by revealing unexpected or humble beginnings
- Demonstrates growth and learning from various experiences
- Explicitly invites others to share their own job histories
- Creates a space for connection through shared experiences

## 18. The "Tips" Post

### Description

This works well when you can provide a really good insight or tip. It doesn't have to be a long post to have an impact, but it should provide clear, actionable value.

### Example

```
Here's the most important closing question every salesperson needs to ask every single time:

"Any reason you wouldn't make a purchase from us today?"

Share your top sales tip in the comments.

```

### Template

```
One of the biggest mistakes in {{business type}} is {{mistake}}.

Never do this. In doing this, you will {{tell them why it is a mistake}}.

Instead, {{tell them what they should do instead}}.

#hashtags

```

### How It Works

- Provides immediate, actionable value in a concise format
- Identifies a common mistake people make (creating recognition)
- Offers a better alternative solution
- Keeps it simple and focused on one specific tip
- Invites others to share their own tips, creating a resource in the comments

## 19. The "Out of Office" Post

### Description

Keep people posted about your vacation and what you are grateful for. Sometimes simple real-life updates are what people want. It gives them a sneak peek behind the scenes of a real human being.

### Example

```
OFFICIAL OUT OF THE OFFICE ALERT

Hey friends! I'm heading to Cuba this week. I chose this destination because the Internet there is the worst. And for me ... that means an actual vacation...

```

### Template

```
Formal Out-Of-Office Announcement!

Hey there! Checking myself out of work and into {{destination}} for some good old R&R. Excited to close the laptop and open a beer. See ya in a {{time you are gone}}!

```

### How It Works

- Breaks from typical business content to show your human side
- Creates a sense of authenticity and work-life balance
- Often generates good wishes and travel recommendations
- Shows that even successful professionals need downtime
- Can spark conversations about vacation spots and work-life balance

## 20. The "Shout Out" Post

### Description

Use this sparingly and carefully to avoid appearing insincere. However, it's a great way to get greater reach by tagging other people who have authority and followers to bring more attention to your content.

### Example

```
Kicking off this week's #LinkedInROCKSTARS list with the acronym created by Jeff Young: "If you want to really get involved, build a network and make a difference on LinkedIn, then be a R-O-C-K-S-T-A-R like this folks:

[List of LinkedIn influencers]

```

### Template

```
Need some tips on {{XXX}}? Here are {{XXX}} companies that are the best go-to experts:

1. {{tag company and why they are an expert}}
2. {{tag company and why they are an expert}}
3. {{tag company and why they are an expert}}

Any other experts you want to give a shout-out to? Tag them below!

```

### How It Works

- Provides value by highlighting genuinely helpful resources
- Creates goodwill with the people/companies you tag
- Increases the likelihood of engagement from those tagged
- Expands your post's reach to their networks
- Positions you as connected and generous in your industry

## 21. The "Moving Infographic" Post

### Description

Dynamic, data-driven visuals capture attention much better than static text. Creating moving infographics (using tools like Flourish) can make your content stand out significantly.

### Example

```
This is interesting, but the bigger problem society has is people spend more time following other's people lives than they do their own lives.

Things that make you go hmmm...? ;)

[Moving infographic showing Instagram follower growth over time]

```

### Template

```
[Moving infographic or chart showing interesting data]

{{Brief insight about what the data reveals}}

{{Optional thought-provoking question about the implications}}

```

### How It Works

- Uses motion to capture attention in the feed
- Presents data visually for easier consumption
- Adds your unique insight to give context to the data
- Often sparks discussions about trends or patterns
- Demonstrates your technical capability and data fluency

## 22. The "How-to Series" Post Strategy

### Description

Creating a series can be a great way to build up your status as an expert in your profession. This approach builds anticipation and keeps your audience coming back for more installments.

### Example

```
Do you want more B2B leads fast?

Then you are going to want to master the art of cold email and understand...

[Content about cold email strategies]

```

### Template

```
Part {{X}} of my {{Topic}} series:

Today we're covering {{specific aspect}}

{{Key insight or tip about this aspect}}

[Optional: Stay tuned for part {{X+1}} where we'll cover {{next topic}}]

#hashtags

```

### How It Works

- Establishes your expertise through in-depth coverage of a topic
- Creates anticipation for future installments
- Allows you to break down complex topics into digestible pieces
- Builds a dedicated audience who follows the entire series
- Positions you as a thought leader in your specific niche

## 23. The "Document" Post

### Description

Creating a 4-5 page document in Canva is one of the easiest ways to create engaging content on LinkedIn. Documents get high engagement and allow you to provide in-depth value.

### Example

```
How to score your dream job.

It's really hard to get noticed.

[Attached document with tips]

```

### Template

```
{{Attention-grabbing headline related to your document}}

{{Brief teaser about the content}}

[Attached document created in Canva or similar tool]

```

### How It Works

- Allows you to share more in-depth content than a regular post
- Creates a professional, visually appealing resource
- Generates higher engagement as people swipe through multiple pages
- Positions you as an expert willing to share detailed knowledge
- Provides tangible value that can be saved or downloaded

## 24. The "Study Summary" Post

### Description

Find interesting data that is a hot topic and touches people emotionally, then write a summary on that data plus a small insight to drive engagement.

### Example

```
These are the most hated email jargons, according to Adobe study:

"Not sure if you saw my last email:"
"Per my last email."
"Per our conversation."

```

### Template

```
According to a study by {{XXX}}, these are the top {{XXX}}:

1.
2.
3.

Are you surprised?

```

### How It Works

- Leverages credible research to support your points
- Presents interesting findings in an easily digestible format
- Adds your own insight or perspective on the data
- Asks a question that invites reactions and comments
- Positions you as well-informed and data-driven

## 25. The "Curiosity" Post

### Description

This approach creates intrigue by writing a hook that snags people's curiosity then hitting the return key multiple times to bury the rest of the story below the fold, forcing readers to click "see more" to get the resolution.

### Example

```
[Hook that creates curiosity]

[Several line breaks]

[Rest of the story revealed only after clicking "see more"]

```

### Template

```
{{Intriguing headline or question}}

[Four or five line breaks]

{{The rest of your content that answers the question or resolves the curiosity}}

```

### How It Works

- Creates immediate curiosity with an intriguing statement or question
- Intentionally hides the answer to encourage clicking "see more"
- That click signals engagement to LinkedIn's algorithm
- Increases read time and engagement metrics
- Makes your post more visible in the feed

## 26. The "Comedy" Post

### Description

Everyone likes to laugh. Sharing something humorous can humanize you and create a break from typical business content. Just keep it professional and appropriate for LinkedIn.

### Example

## 27. The "Doing The Unexpected" Post

### Description

This type of post works by sharing a story where someone has wronged you but you responded with kindness instead. People love these posts because they demonstrate character and values.

### Example

```
In are politeness, I got this message "I won't be coming for the interview. I have an interview with Amazon on the same day."

We invited a young web developer for an interview after he applied for the role. Unfortunately for him, it clashed with another interview. He messaged us that he wouldn't come.

Although it looked a bit awkward, this was a young man who had never been employed since he graduated two years ago. To be invited by a company like Amazon is huge for him. I could imagine. We wished him well.

Three days after, he contacted us that he didn't get the job. He asked if he could still be interviewed. Of course! We rescheduled him. He came and did well. We hired him.

He couldn't believe that he could still get the job. He was on cloud nine and so teary. He couldn't stop thanking me...

I told him I had not done anything special...

All I see in you is talent. I can't prevent you from going to a big company. I feel happy when people are making progress. Amazon inviting you shows that you are unique. Enjoy your success.

He resumed and did well for us before moving to a bigger company a couple of years after.

The sky is vast for everyone to fly. When job seekers or employees see more significant opportunities, support them. Let them go. Be happy for them.

```

### Template

```

### Example

```
10 ideas for dealing with stress this week (maybe more if you read the comments):

1. Spend time in nature - nothing beats a 20-minute walk through a forest.
2. Exercise - it's proven that exercise releases all the right chemicals to combat stress and depression.
3. Find a mentor - sometimes a few words from a wise and trusted person can get you pointed in the right direction.
4. Call a friend - sometimes just shooting the s*"t with your BFF is all that is needed.
5. Meditate - Stillness and silence (even for 5 mins) can recenter the busiest of people.
6. Know when to leave - Sometimes, taking a break is the best thing you can do.
7. Be grateful - Write down 3 things you are grateful for, it's hard to get upset when you are grateful
8. Volunteer - Go spend a couple of hours at your local homeless shelter and most of your problems and stress will melt away. All we need sometimes is perspective.
9. ????
10. ????

Help! I ran out of ideas.

What should # 9 and # 10 be?... or tell us which number is your go-to when you are feeling a little stressed in the comments.

I would love to hear your thoughts below!

Because I couldn't do 12 pull-ups.
But they sent me to Afghanistan anyway.

I was a Fire Support Officer.
But not Ranger-qualified.
Not a day went by when I didn't think about that tab.

Even after I earned everyone's respect by keeping my soldiers safe.

When I came back to my base in Italy after 15 months of combat-
My girlfriend moved across the ocean to be with me.
2 weeks later, I decided to leave and try again.

"You better come back wearing that tab," she told me
So I flew to the US.
Spent 2 months in the snowy Georgia mountains and Florida swamps without sleep.
Lost 30 pounds.
And was so exhausted I started hallucinating.

But I passed.

```

I failed {{XXX}}.
Because I couldn't {{XXX}}.

Invest in your employees!

## 40. Let's Connect Post

### Description

This works because you give everyone permission to connect. It's what people secretly want - to expand their network - but they don't want to be spammy doing it. When you make the post explicitly about networking, everyone knows what it's about and people jump in.

### Example

```
LinkedIn is one of the best and easiest ways to network.

Let me show you how easy this is.

You can immediately grow your network in 3 very easy steps, right now!

Step 1 - Like this post.
Step 2 - Comment below if you're open to new connections. The first 100-200 people that comment get the most growth!
Step 3 - Send a personalized connection request to everyone that leaves a comment.

If you connect with me you get access to 25K new 2nds. Note! I only accept personalized connections. ;)

You'll have new conversations with like-minded folks who want to network with you.

Maybe you've heard about the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon before?
It doesn't even have to take 6 connections.
You are only 1 connection away from finding your next opportunity.

If you want to grow, then comment below to grow your network.

If you don't know what to say... just say... "I'm open to networking" or "LinkedIn rocks!"

It can't get any easier!

```

### Template

```
LinkedIn is the easiest platform to expand your network and make ideal connections. Here's how:

Step 1: {{XXX}}
Step 2: {{XXX}}
Step 3: {{XXX}}

That's it!

When you {{XXX}}, you gain {{XXX}}.

Comment below if {{XXX}}.

```

### How It Works

- Provides explicit permission to network (removing the awkwardness)
- Creates a structured process that feels safe and appropriate
- Offers immediate value (new connections)

## 42. I call BS Post

### Description

This type of post challenges conventional wisdom or clichés by boldly calling them out as false, then providing a more realistic perspective.

### Example

```
"If you build it, they will come."

BS.

An entrepreneur asked me for advice last week. He's been working on a product so futuristic it's 5 steps ahead of the market.

The problem: he has zero clients.
And he's running out of money.

"What am I doing wrong?" he asked me.

"The market will never come to you," I said. "You have to go to the market."

It's a story I've heard hundreds of time.

And it's the reason why so many entrepreneurs fail-
They're not building something people need now.

A ton of customers magically showing up after you build something-
Only happens in Hollywood films.

Unless you've got a billion dollars in cash and you can see into the future-
You have to find your target audience now-
Identify a pain they're experiencing-
And come up with a damn good solution for it.

```

### Template

```
{{cliche quote}}

That's just BS.

Here's the problem with that statement: {{XXX}}

Instead, {{XXX}}.

In the long run, {{XXX}}.

```

### How It Works

- Creates immediate attention with a contrarian position

- Often draws from personal experience to build credibility
- Positions you as a straight-talker who cuts through hype

```

## 45. The "Would You" Post

### Description

If a company offered you a 10% pay cut, BUT allowed you to work from home on Fridays, would you take it?

```

### Template

```
If you could {{XXX}}, would it be {{XXX}} or {{XXX}}?

Personally, I would {{XXX}} because {{XXX}}. Now I am interested to hear your take on it.

### Description

Getting fired is always a hot topic on LinkedIn. Creating a post around it tends to get engagement because it touches on fears and experiences many professionals share.

### Example

```
Why do clients fire their marketing agency?
Let me tell you Why.

I talk to 3-8 companies every day who are looking for a new marketing agency to help them with their marketing because the previous marketing agency dropped the ball with any one of these things:

1. Made a mistake and then didn't report on it up, so they lost total trust.
2. Made a mistake and didn't catch it because no one was looking at his or her account
3. Delivered different work then what was in the SOW.
4. Flat, down or little results.
5. Reporting contained no insights and no recommendations.
6. No innovation and no suggestions for new marketing ideas.
7. Low or zero communication.

I'm curious....what was the reason(s) you fired a marketing agency in the past...?

```

### Template

```
Getting fired is always a terrible experience.

Here's why {{XXX}} get fired:

## 50. The "What Really Matters in Life" Post

### Description

Everyone loves a good inspirational post. If you tie these posts to Friday or to holidays and tell people to enjoy their weekends/holidays, it can perform especially well.

### Example

```
My mother recently retired. She had this quote taped to her computer: "Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air. You name them work, family, health, friends and spirit. And you're keeping all of these in the air. You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls - family, health, friends and spirit - are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered. They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life." - Brian Dyson, former CEO of Coca-Cola

It served my Mom well.

I will now print off this same quote/passage and add it to the wall of my office too.

I think we do a pretty good job of promoting this at @poweredbysearch, but it's that important of a reminder that I want it front and center so I can always remember what is really important in life.

```

### Template

```
It's {{Friday/Holiday}} and we are all working hard, but remember what really matters in life.

Here are 10 things you could do this weekend to create more memories you can cherish.

1. Idea
2. Idea
3. Idea
4. Idea
5. Idea

Which one will you do this weekend? Put the number in the comments or write your own ideas, if you have something different in mind.

## 52. The "Say No" Post

### Description

Everyone has things they know they need to say "No" to, but often struggle with setting boundaries. This post provides permission and strategies for declining commitments.

### Example

```
When you are young, saying "yes" to many things is very powerful and important, but as you age and define who you are, then learning to say "no" becomes essential. Here's a list of things I've learned to say, "no, thanks" to.

1. {{XXX}}
2. {{XXX}}
3. {{XXX}}
4. {{XXX}}
5. {{XXX}}
6. {{XXX}}
7. {{XXX}}

I'm curious, what have you learned to say "no to" that improves your life.

```

### How It Works

- Validates the challenge of setting boundaries
- Provides examples that readers can relate to
- Shows how saying "no" can be strategic, not selfish
- Encourages personal reflection and growth
- Invites others to share their own boundary-setting experiences

## 53. The "______ Doesn't Want to Hear" Post

### Description

Everyone has had an experience when they're told something that isn't what they want to hear. This post exposes uncomfortable truths in a way that creates recognition and engagement.

### Example

```
Experience says: "I will let you know." is the thing job seekers don't want to hear.

Trust me, "You are not selected" is much better. Agree?

#jobseekers #jobs #seekers

```

### Template

```
{{XXX}} doesn't want to hear "{{XXX}}".

Instead, they want to hear "{{XXX}}"

Agree…?

```

### How It Works

- Addresses common frustrations or uncomfortable truths
- Creates immediate recognition from readers
- Provides a preferred alternative to problematic responses
- Invites agreement or disagreement
- Often addresses communication challenges in professional relationships

## 54. The "Secret Sauce/Superpower" Post

### Description

This type of post allows you to share your unique abilities while encouraging others to reflect on their own strengths and weaknesses, creating community through shared self-awareness.

### Example

```
Everyone has a unique ability. The more time you spend working on your superpowers the happier you'll be.

My super powers have always been:
1.
2.
3.

My weakness (kryptonite) have always been:
1.
2.
3.

The trick is to find people who's super powers are your kryptonite and then work together, so you can become a super machine.

If you work on your weaknesses, all you end up with a bunch of mediocre weaknesses.

If you agree with this concept, write "agree!" in the comments.

And if you are brave enough, list your top 3 super powers and top 3 weaknesses.

Trust me it feels good to say it out loud.

## 55. The "This vs That" Post

### Description

This is a simple but effective format that presents a binary choice and asks for opinions. It's a quick way to generate engagement on topics relevant to your industry.

### Example

```
A lousy job with a good boss is better than a good job with a lousy boss. Agree?

I was talking to a friend this weekend and they told me about this terrible experience they had at work.

They said to me, "My boss made a mistake on a project we were working on, and instead of owning his mistake, he said it was my fault. I sat through that meeting feeling shocked and disappointed. When we left the meeting, he told me, 'You are a good sport.' I knew I needed to start planning my exit strategy. I love my job, but I can't trust my boss."

It's demotivating being under a bad manager. I've had some bad bosses and it really makes a huge difference on "whom you work with" vs "what you work on" each day. I think a lousy job with a good boss and great co-workers is better than a good job with a lousy boss or co-workers who don't have your back.

I'm curious...what do you think...? Comment below.

```

### Template

```
{{XXX}} is better than {{XXX}}

Here's why: {{XXX}}

Agree or Disagree? Let me know in the comments.

```

### How It Works

- Creates a clear, binary choice that's easy to respond to
- Encourages opinions and discussion
- Often touches on professional values or priorities
- Can be supported with a personal story for greater impact
- Makes engagement extremely low-friction

## 56. "The language of successful ___________" Document Post

### Description

These work because they're essentially listicles in document form. You can create them easily with tools like Canva and they provide immediately valuable frameworks.

### Example

```
The language of successful managers:

1. "What's on your mind?"
[Additional points in the document]

```

### Template

```
The language of successful {{XXX}}:

1. {{XXX}}
2. {{XXX}}
3. {{XXX}}
4. {{XXX}}
5. {{XXX}}
6. {{XXX}}
7. {{XXX}}

What should number {{XXX}} be…?

Which number do you think is the most important…?

#hashtags

```

- Provides practical language and phrases readers can immediately use
- Creates a referenceable resource others might save
- Leaves an open question to drive comments
- Positions you as an expert on effective communication in your field

## 57. "The Dark Side of ______________" Post

### Description

Pointing out the less-discussed challenges or downsides of popular trends or careers can be powerful and generate important conversations.

### Example

```
No talks about this.

The dark side of entrepreneurship.

2X more likely to suffer from depression
6X more likely to suffer from ADHD
3X more likely to suffer from substance abuse
2X more likely to have suicidal thoughts

Having our own business may seem like a cool and fun thing to do, but it's not easy for most.

This is why more than 80% of small businesses fail.

Yesterday was national HUG day.
Feb 12th.
I just found out about that today.
Who knew there was such a day.

I missed it by a day, but you know what… let's give out some hugs today.

Next time you want to hate an owner, you may want to give them a hug instead, as their job is probably way more stressful and harder than you could ever imagine.

Comment #hugsforentrepreaurs, if you want to send your appreciation to these hard working folks.

And tag some hard working entrepreneurs you know in the comments.

```

### Template

```
The dark side of {{XXX}} that nobody talks about:

- {{Challenging aspect}}
- {{Challenging aspect}}
- {{Challenging aspect}}
- {{Challenging aspect}}

{{Provide context for why these challenges exist}}

{{Call to action for support or awareness}}

#hashtags

```

### How It Works

- Addresses rarely-discussed challenges of popular careers or trends
- Creates authenticity through honest acknowledgment of difficulties
- Shows empathy for those facing these challenges
- Often provides a balanced perspective on glamorized roles
- Creates space for others to share their experiences with these challenges

## 58. "You Can't Google _____________" Post

### Description

There's always something that can't be easily looked up and needs to be earned through experience. This post type highlights the value of experiential knowledge.

### Example

```
You can't Google experience! Tech companies are looking for that 28-year-old with 20 years experience. Well, guess what...?! It doesn't exist.

I think a lot of tech companies would do a lot better if they saw the value in experience. The tech can be learned, as they say, if you have the will you can get the skill. I think AGEISM in the tech workplace is very real and can't be made acceptable anymore. Everyone is going to need to help to solve this problem.

It's time for a change.

```

### Template

```
Point blank, you can't Google {{XXX}}! Companies are looking for {{XXX}}, but it simply won't work by Googling it.

I think it would be better if {{XXX}}.

Thoughts?

```

### How It Works

- Highlights the irreplaceable value of experience and wisdom
- Creates immediate agreement from those with experience
- Often addresses industry blind spots or prejudices
- Provides a more realistic perspective on skill development
- Can spark important conversations about industry practices

## 59. "Cut ______ From Your Life" Post

### Description

This type of post provides permission and frameworks for eliminating negative influences, which most people want to do but struggle with.

### Example

```
Cut toxic people from your life! How do you know if you have toxic people in your life?

1. They blame everyone for their problems (it's never their fault)
2. They talk behind people's backs.
3. They take more than they give.
4. They are constant debbie-downers, nothing is ever going well.
5. Their lives are constantly full of drama.
6. They can't let go when people have done them wrong.
7. They have an intense need to be right.
8. They dominate the conversation, really is a one way conversation.

We all go through a tough time in life and we all have had our boo-hoo moments of victimitis, however, if you have a friend, family or colleague who is ALWAYS like the above, then…

CUT-THEM-OUT-OF-YOUR-LIFE!

If someone is just having a tough time, give it some time and help them get outta their funk.

However, if they are truly toxic, then run the other way when you see them.

These toxic people will suck you dry and if you give them the time, they'll come back to do it again and again, until you decide to disengage.

Don't even feel like you owe them an explanation.

Most of the time they won't "get it" anyways and you'll just be another person who's wronged them.

My advice is to remove them and block them on social media and stop engaging.

It's harsh, but true.

Life is short, spend with those that energize you and met you in the middle.

Agree…?

Comment #nomoretoxicpeople if you agree.

```

### Template

```
Cut {{XXX}} from your life! How do you know if you have {{XXX}} in your life?

1. {{Sign/Behavior}}
2. {{Sign/Behavior}}
3. {{Sign/Behavior}}
4. {{Sign/Behavior}}
5. {{Sign/Behavior}}

{{Provide context and nuance}}

{{Explain why removal is necessary}}

{{Offer practical advice for removal}}

Life is too short for {{XXX}}.

Agree?

Comment #hashtag if you agree.

```

### How It Works

- Provides clear criteria for identifying negative influences
- Creates immediate recognition of these patterns
- Offers permission to prioritize one's wellbeing
- Provides practical advice for difficult situations
- Balances empathy with necessary boundaries

## 60. The "Values" Post

### Description

People don't buy WHAT you sell, but WHY you do it. These posts reveal your core values through personal stories, helping others connect with your deeper motivations.

### Example

```
My dad passed when I was 10. He was hardworking, humble, always smiling, had travelled the world, and was loved and appreciated by everyone he met. He could cheer up your day with a smile and a wink, or a cheeky comment. At his funeral, the church was BURSTING with people who wanted to say goodbye. He had no money, very little education, but he MATTERED to people, even those who barely knew him. He was 41.

My grandfather passed when I was 32. He was a narcissist. He was selfish self congratulatory, and he never did anything for anyone unless there was something in it for himself. Family would visit him begrudgingly. He made you feel bad about yourself in subtle ways. He was a bully, with no friends. At his funeral, a few people came, out of a sense of duty. No one cried. No one would miss him. He was 78.

Memories of both of these events shape my behaviour every single day, because I'd rather die young, having lived a life that mattered and made a difference, than live a long, lonely life filled with negativity.

```

### Template

```
[Tell a personal story that illustrates your core values]

```

### How It Works

- Creates emotional connection through personal storytelling
- Reveals your deeper motivations and character
- Helps potential clients/employers understand your "why"
- Creates authenticity and humanizes your professional persona
- Often creates strong resonance with those who share similar values

## 61. The Question Strategy Post

### Description

This strategy works by asking the community a direct, thought-provoking question that invites multiple perspectives.

### Example

```
QUESTION: If your company asked you to work 10 hours a day vs "8 hrs", but said you can have ALL Fridays off so every week is 4-day work week would you say, "Yes" or "No" and why...?

What are the PROs and CONs of moving an organization to 4 day work week vs a 5-day work week...?

#hr #workweek #challengingthestatusquo #productivity

```

### Template

```
QUESTION: If {{XXX}} asked you to {{XXX}} vs {{XXX}}, but said {{XXX}}, would you say "Yes" or "No"?

As a follow-up, what is your argument for your answer? Why "Yes" or why "No"? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

```

### How It Works

- Creates immediate engagement with a clear, thought-provoking question
- Frames the question as a realistic professional scenario
- Encourages nuanced thinking beyond simple yes/no
- Often touches on current workplace trends or challenges
- Creates valuable discussion in the comments section

## 62. The "Let's Connect" Post

### Description

This approach works by giving explicit permission for networking. LinkedIn is fundamentally about connecting, but many people feel awkward about reaching out. This post removes that barrier.

### Example

```
LinkedIn is one of the best and easiest ways to network.

Let me show you how easy this is.

You can immediately grow your network in 3 very easy steps, right now!

Step 2 - Comment below if you're open to new connections. The first 100-200 people that comment get the most growth!

```

### How It Works

- Creates a safe space for networking
- Provides a structured process for making connections
- Explicitly invites engagement with clear steps
- Explains the benefits of expanding one's network
- Leverages the post's reach to connect multiple people

## 63. The "Wrong/Right Question" Post

### Description

This approach reframes common questions to more productive alternatives, demonstrating your expertise and ability to approach problems differently.

### Example

```
The wrong question: How long does it take to write a post?

The right question: How long does it take to write a post that is worth reading, bookmarking, sharing & coming back to?

#ContentMarketing #Blogging #Content #Strategy #Marketing #ContentStrategy #ContentWriting

```

### Template

```
The Wrong Question: {{XXX}}

The Right Question: {{XXX}}

```

### How It Works

- Immediately demonstrates your strategic thinking
- Reframes common challenges in more productive ways
- Shows your expertise through better problem formulation
- Creates "aha" moments for readers
- Often provides a fresh perspective on familiar challenges

## 64. Why We Should Connect Post

### Description

This post works because it directly addresses common objections to connecting with strangers on LinkedIn, reframing professional networking as a positive opportunity.

### Example

```
5 Reasons To Accept Connection Requests from Strangers:

1. This isn't Facebook. They're called "connections" not "friends".
2. You're building a professional network not a private golf club.
3. New connections bring new ideas from outside your social media echo chamber.
4. Your next client or supplier might come from a stranger's network.
5. Everyone you know, including your best friends, were once strangers.

Are you open to connect? Comment below.

## 65. The Shoutout Post Template

### Description

This approach works by highlighting others in your industry who provide value, creating goodwill and often reciprocal mentions.

### Example

```
I'm tired of seeing the same people on marketing "influencer" and thought leadership lists. It's the individuals in the trenches we should be recognizing.

This is who I look to for marketing and leadership advice. Thanks to all of you.

[List of marketing professionals with their titles and companies]

Give all of them a follow. They are top notch.

```

### Template

```
[Introductory statement about why you're highlighting these individuals]

Here are [number] people doing amazing work in [your industry]:

[List names and brief descriptions of why they're valuable to follow]

Give them a follow if you're interested in [topic/industry].

#shoutout #[industry]

```

### How It Works

- Creates goodwill with those you mention
- Provides value to your audience by curating quality connections
- Positions you as well-connected in your industry
- Often leads to reciprocal mentions or engagement
- Shows generosity and community-mindedness

## 66. The Employee Rant Post

### Description

These posts perform well, especially when you advocate for employee rights and fair treatment in the workplace, because they tap into common frustrations.

### Example

```
Millions of American workers learned the hard way that when times get tough, employers will cut and run.

Loyalty has always been a one way street (despite what you've been told) and employees will always be the first to go in an attempt to cut costs.

Did you know the average CEO compensation has grown nearly 950% since 1978?

Did you also know that the people left behind are expected to do your job and their job? And, maybe even take a cut in pay?

Trust me when I say, they will continue to do business the same way, with less people, while their Executives continue to enjoy the same perks and benefits as always.

Before you tell me how this one or that one took a pay cut, keep in mind that a pay cut to a salary is nothing ... most of the compensation comes in the form of stock and bonus. So while it might be good PR to broadcast how this CEO and that CEO is taking a pay-cut, they are impacted very, very little.

But this post is not about them, this post is about YOU.

Keep loyalty in perspective.
Don't feel guilty for taking a better offer elsewhere.
Looking out for you and your family first is not being selfish, it is being an adult.

#jobsearch #numberone #loyaltoyou

### Template

```
[Opening statement about unfair workplace practice or trend]

[Supporting details or statistics about the issue]

[Explanation of why this matters to employees]

[Empowering message directly to employees about their rights/worth]

```

### How It Works

- Addresses common workplace frustrations and injustices
- Advocates for employee empowerment and fair treatment
- Often provides a counter-narrative to corporate messaging

- Positions you as an advocate for fairness and ethical business practices

## 67. The Who Should Do This Job Post

### Description

This framework highlights the unrecognized challenges of specific roles, creating appreciation and recognition for those who perform these demanding jobs.

### Example

```
Which co-founder should be CEO?

Whomever is most willing:
- To do the fundraising. For real
- To be point person on all key dramas
- To be the fall person when big mistakes are made
- To recruit the VPs no one else can
- To be the one blamed by the board
- To get on jets (once we can again)
- To never quit, no matter what

```

### Template

```
Who should do {{XXX}} job?

Whomever is most willing:
- To do {{XXX}}
- To do {{XXX}}

- To do {{XXX}}
- To do {{XXX}}

```

### How It Works

- Reveals the hidden or unappreciated aspects of specific roles
- Creates recognition for those who perform challenging jobs
- Often adds humor or candor about difficult responsibilities
- Helps readers better understand what certain roles truly entail
- Can address misconceptions about glamorized positions

## 68. State The Opposite Post

### Description

This approach works by challenging conventional wisdom with a counterintuitive perspective, creating immediate interest through contradiction.

### Example

```
I stopped working on weekends, and my company grew faster.

Overworking is overrated.

#entrepreneurship

```

### Template

```
I stopped {{XXX}}, and my {{XXX}} grew faster.

{{XXX}} is overrated.

```

### How It Works

- Creates immediate attention through contradiction
- Challenges common beliefs about success or productivity
- Often provides a healthier, more sustainable alternative
- Gives permission for others to question conventional wisdom
- Positions you as someone who thinks independently

## 69. The Mistake Post

### Description

Admitting mistakes makes you human and relatable. Showing how you learned from them demonstrates growth and values.

### Example

```
You can't ask if a candidate has kids.

I forgot that during an interview...

They paused, gave a weird look and said "no".

I forget people discriminate against parents.

Our team has 15 kids, 4 of them are mine.

We might show up after 9am drop off. We often leave at 5 for dinner. We might run if school calls...

But we do amazing work in between.

We don't succeed despite our families... We succeed because of them.

```

### Template

```
You can't {{XXX}}.

I forgot that during {{XXX}}.

I forget people {{XXX}} and that is why you can't do that.

Our team {{XXX}} and {{XXX}} and we support {{XXX}}.

```

### How It Works

- Creates vulnerability through admission of mistakes
- Demonstrates growth and learning
- Often addresses important ethical or legal considerations
- Shows your values in action, not just in theory
- Creates connection through shared human experiences

## 70. The Bad Boss Post

### Description

Everyone can relate to having a bad boss. These posts tap into universal experiences and create immediate emotional connection.

### Example

```
My boss raised his voice at me.

Told me I was too young to succeed at the bank.

Half the office heard him. I was humiliated.

We never spoke again.

I quit a few weeks later to start a competitor...

Planswell served more clients in year one than he's served in his entire life.

People don't quit over money, perks, the office.
They quit disrespectful bosses.

```

### Template

```
My boss {{XXX}}.

Told me {{XXX}}.

Half the office heard him/her. I was humiliated.

We never spoke again.

I quit.

People don't quit over {{XXX}}, {{XXX}}, or {{XXX}}.

They quit over disrespectful bosses.

```

### How It Works

- Creates immediate emotional connection through shared experiences
- Tells a compelling story with conflict and resolution
- Demonstrates consequences of poor leadership
- Provides an important lesson about management and retention
- Often inspires others to share their own bad boss stories

## 71. What Gets The Axe Post

### Description

Create a list of pet-peeves or industry jargon and ask people what they'd most like to eliminate. This works because people love to weigh in on what bothers them professionally.

### Example

```
You can delete 1 buzzword from existence:
- KPI
- Ping
- OKR
- Gamify
- Synergy
- Influencer
- Bandwidth
- Engagement
- Omnichannel
- Low-hanging fruit
- Thought Leadership

What gets the 🪓?

```

### Template

```

- {{Pet-peeve}}
- {{Pet-peeve}}
- {{Pet-peeve}}

- {{Pet-peeve}}

What gets the 🪓?

```

### How It Works

- Often generates humorous responses and shared commiseration
- Reveals what genuinely bothers people in your industry
- Creates a sense of community through shared pet peeves

## 72. Something You'll Never Hear Me Say Post

### Description

This works well because it's a great way to state your values without coming across as preachy. It shows your principles through the actions and words you won't tolerate.

### Example

```
"That's not my job."

Is something you'll never hear me say. I'm a Director of Marketing at Siege Media but in the past week I've...
- Written a blog post because our content marketing team was already booked up
- Helped HR with vetting and interviewing new applications
- Cleaned out the office fridge (thankfully, it was mostly empty since COVID hit.)

Sometimes you have to do things outside of your role and just get the work done.

```

### Template

```
"{{XXX}}"

Is something you'll never hear me say. I'm the {{job title}} at {{company name}} and in the last week I've…
- Awesome thing you did
- Awesome thing you did
- Awesome thing you did

```

### How It Works

- Demonstrates your values through concrete actions rather than abstract statements
- Shows your work ethic and approach to teamwork
- Creates authenticity through specific, real examples
- Positions you as someone who goes beyond job descriptions
- Often resonates with others who share similar values

## 73. Terrible Things Can Happen To You Post

### Description

This post works because it provides inspiration when terrible things happen to good people, especially things outside their control. It creates perspective and resilience.

### Example

```
Remember that you can:
- get laid off
- get furloughed
- job hunt for years
- have gaps in your resume
- start over as many times as you need to

and STILL be successful in life.

```

### Template

```
Remember that you can:
- Terrible thing happening
- Terrible thing happening

- Terrible thing happening
- Terrible thing happening

And you can STILL be successful in life.

```

### How It Works

- Creates perspective during challenging times
- Normalizes common professional setbacks
- Provides hope and resilience
- Removes shame from career disruptions
- Creates connection through shared struggles

## 74. The "Share Your Goals" Post

### Description

People love to share and help. Being a little vulnerable about your aspirations can go a long way on LinkedIn.

### Example

```
They say writing down and publicly sharing your goals increases your chances at achieving them.

So here are some of my goals
A. {{XXX}}
B. {{XXX}}
C. {{XXX}}

Let me know which one you think I should focus on first in the comments.

Tell me yours in the comments too.

Thanks!

```

### Template

```

### How It Works

- Creates accountability through public commitment
- Shows vulnerability and openness to input
- Invites helpful suggestions and resources
- Encourages community through shared goals

### Example

```
LINKEDIN GIVEAWAY! & the lucky winners are.........

[Details about a giveaway and winners]

```

### Template

```
[GIVEAWAY ANNOUNCEMENT]

I'm giving away {{valuable item or service}} to {{number}} lucky people who:

```

### How It Works

- Creates excitement and immediate engagement
- Demonstrates generosity and confidence in your offerings
- Expands your reach as people engage to enter
- Can create ongoing engagement as people check for winners

## 76. The Test a New Product Poll Strategy

### Description

This is a great strategy to test product-market fit with your LinkedIn audience before fully developing a new offering. It lets you validate demand before investing resources.

### Example

```
If I could create all your personal branding content, & I only needed you for 1.5 hrs per month, would you be interested in learning more?

[Poll: Yes/No/Maybe, depends]

```

### Template

```
If I could {{XXX}} and it ONLY cost {{XXX}}, would you be interested in learning more?

[Poll options]

```

### How It Works

- Creates a list of potential early customers
- Shows you're responsive to audience needs
- Minimizes the risk of developing unwanted offerings

## 77. Re-Post A Viral Tweet Post Strategy

### Description

This works well because you're sharing content that has already proven popular. Be sure to give credit and add your own insight to make it relevant to your audience.

### Example

```
I'm all for celebrating amazing things young folks do, but some of us don't hit our stride until we are 40+, I know that was true for me.

[Embedded tweet about appreciating late bloomers]

```

### Template

```
[Your perspective or addition to the viral content]

[Embedded viral tweet/post with credit to original creator]

#hashtags

```

### How It Works

- Leverages already-proven popular content
- Adds your own perspective for originality
- Creates easy engagement with minimal effort
- Properly credits original creators
- Often resonates with your audience if well-chosen

## 78. Tell Someone's Else's Awesome Story Post

### Description

Sharing inspirational stories about others can be powerful and positioning. It demonstrates your values while avoiding seeming self-promotional.

### Example

```
The man on the left is Delonte West. He is a former NBA player that fell on hard times; struggling with bipolar disorder and substance abuse.

He earned around $16 million dollars during his playing career. Today he is homeless... scratch that. He WAS homeless. He was homeless until the man on the right heard about Delonte's plight.

The man on the right is Mark Cuban. He is currently worth 4.3 billion dollars. He heard that West had been seen panhandling at a gas station in the Dallas area. Cuban got in his car and searched him out. Cuban didn't send for someone to go get West, he went himself. He wanted to be certain that West got in the car; He wanted to make sure West would accept treatment - so he went to make the pitch himself.

You see, West played for Cuban's Dallas Mavericks and Cuban was just looking after one of his own. West, in fact, did get into Cuban's car and is on his way to recovering his life

Message:
1. Actions always speak louder than a checkbook.
2. When it's important enough, its personal.

```

### Template

```
[Tell an inspiring story about someone else]

## 79. The Shoutout Post

### Description

This strategy works well when you give specific, genuine recognition to others in your industry. It creates goodwill while positioning you as well-connected and generous.

### Example

```
Here are 4 brilliant copywriters you are probably not following on LinkedIn but should be.

1. Eden Bidani - She's a brilliant conversion copywriter who posts daily tips on copywriting. Her tips are super actionable. Taking it and adjusting your copy a little each day can be a game-changer for your landing pages and email sequences.

2. Joel Klettke - His sense of humour and authenticity rings through in everything he writes. It's a great lesson on how not to be beige or boring. He also runs the best B2B case study company in town.

3. Nikki Elbaz - She seems to be able to spot the most amazing copywriting examples across the web and shares an example each day. It's so helpful and inspiring to see what she finds and how you could use it in your business. Pure gold!

4. Justin Blackman - He's amazing at showing people how to find their voice and to make that voice stand out. I love his one-liners. So hard to write a solid one-liner!

If you are not following these 4 amazing and smart copywriters on LinkedIn you are missing out. Their posts will literally make you loads more $$$. When it does, make sure you cut them a check. ;)

## 80. Name Thy Enemy Post

### Description

This works because you can call out (sometimes humorously) people's shared frustrations, creating immediate recognition and connection.

### Example

```
Just remember... when life is tough. When your husband/wife/kids get mad at you. When your boss/employees/coworkers hurt your feelings. When things just generally don't go your way.

You can still trash salespeople on the internet.

All hope is not lost, keyboard warrior. You got this!

```

### Template

```
[Humorous setup about common frustrations]

[Name a common "enemy" or frustration in your industry]

[Ironic encouragement or reflection]

#hashtags

```

### How It Works

- Creates immediate recognition through shared frustrations
- Uses humor to address common pain points
- Creates a sense of community through shared experiences
- Often defuses tension around difficult topics
- Can highlight absurdities in professional culture

## 81. The Scorned/Revenge Story Post

### Description

This works because everyone can relate to being wronged professionally and enjoys seeing justice or personal triumph emerge from an unfair situation.

### Example

```
She didn't get the promotion she'd been promised.

She had worked her ass off, managing a bigger team and 'unofficially' filled the role left vacant by her boss who left the company.

When the bosses boss approached her to step in a fill the role temporarily, he'd assured her she would be a shoo in when the position was filled.

He lied.

For 6 months, she did her own job and the job her old boss left. She did it without any extra pay. She did it without any title or perk or support.

She was thrilled when she got the call to officially interview for the promotion, thought it would be a formality. It wasn't.

Delay after delay, excuse after excuse, nearly 8 months assuming this temporary role, she was told they were bringing in an outside candidate to fill the job. (An old buddy of the COO).

She was crushed! Devastated. She felt foolish and embarrassed.

When she called us to work with her on her resume, she was defeated and depressed. After talking with me she got mad and fired up! (I tend to do that).

This week, after a 3 month job search, she landed that same VP level job at a competitor of her old employer where she'll go head to head with the guy that got her promotion.

She's got something to prove.

#resumewriting #dontpissoffsmartwomen #success

```

### Template

```
She/he didn't get {{XXX}} she'd/he'd been promised.

She/he worked their ass off by ….

When the boss told her/him ….

She/he was thrilled when they ....

Months had gone by and still no …

Then they found out …

They were rightfully crushed.

60 days later she/he ended up ....

Now that boss needs to deal with …

Who do you think has more energy to win?

```

### How It Works

- Creates an emotionally engaging narrative arc
- Addresses common workplace injustices
- Provides satisfaction through ultimate triumph
- Often validates feelings of being undervalued
- Inspires others in similar situations to persevere

## 82. The Book Screenshot Post

### Description

This approach works by sharing powerful wisdom from books you've read. It positions you as well-read while providing value from trusted authorities.

### Example

```
[Screenshot of book passage]

"Two Beers and a Puppy": A Helpful Test for Determining How You Feel About Someone

"Two Beers and a Puppy" is a test that I developed while working on an Esquire story on the American "son of a bitch." The test is: In order to find out how you actually feel about someone, ask yourself: "Would I have two beers with this person?" And: "Would I allow this person to look after my puppy over a weekend?"

[Additional text from the book]

```

### Template

```

## 83. The "3 Things XXX Wish They Could Tell XXX" Post

This works well because you get to reveal what people are really thinking but may be hesitant to say directly. It creates intrigue and insider perspective.

### Example

```
Are you a CEO?
Do you know what your second-in-command wishes s/he could tell you?

Here are 3 things they wish they could tell you:
1. [First insight]
2. [Second insight]
3. [Third insight]

```

### Template

```
Are you a {{XXX}}?
Do you know what XXX could tell you…?

Here are 3 things they wish they could tell you:
1. {{XXX}}
2. {{XXX}}
3. {{XXX}}

Have you been fired? How did you deal with it?

Today I'm sharing a story about how I was fired as COO at a $100M company...

[Story about being fired]

And I started to cry

```

### Template

```
Have you ever been fired or laid off?

Here's my story:

```

### How It Works

- Normalizes a common but stigmatized professional experience
- Provides hope and perspective for others in similar situations
- Shows resilience and growth from setbacks
- Often leads to others sharing their own experiences

## 85. State your BEFORE and AFTER Transformation

### Description

This works because people love transformation stories. Showing your journey creates connection and demonstrates growth.

### Example

```
Kristina before:
Uses Firefox
Loves Excel and is sure she'll never switch it to Google Sheets

Kristina after:
Uses Chrome ALL THE TIME (even my SEO Pro extension is currently available only for Chrome)
Can't live without Google Sheets

What's your before/after? Share in the comments!

```

### Template

```
I used to love {{XXX}}.
Until now. Now I love {{XXX}}.

```

### How It Works

- Often addresses changing industry trends or tools
- Invites others to reflect on their own transformations
- Creates connections through shared journeys

## 86. The Unfair Post

### Description

This works really well when you point out genuinely unfair practices (especially in the workplace) that many people experience but few address directly.

### Example

```
Loaf of Bread $1.99
Gallon of Milk $3.99
Happy Meal $3.29
House $350,000
Car $32,500
Pizza $20
Pair of Shoes I don't need $100

Every single thing I am going to buy (whether I need it or not) starts off by telling me the price.

Job Salary Information
(Negotiable)
(Range)
(To Be Determined)
(Based on Experience)
(Based on Managers Mood)
(Based on Location)
(Based on the least amount we can get away with)

People need jobs.
You need people.
Publish the damn salary.

#resumewriting #jobsearch #success

```

### Template

```
[Describe an unfair practice or double standard]

[Provide context or examples that highlight the unfairness]

[Make a clear, direct call for change]

#hashtags

```

- Positions you as an advocate for fairness
- Can generate significant engagement from others who share the frustration

## 87. Answer a common question post followed by an AMA offer

### Description

Answering FAQs as snackable content is a great way to add value. Following up with an "Ask Me Anything" invitation creates engagement opportunities.

### Example

```
"How do I get access to more people in my account when my main contact won't let me talk to anyone?"

1. Easiest: Set the expectation on who needs to be involved, clearly - not implied, in the first meeting or onboarding call. Make it sound normal and typical and you will be shocked how many people go with it.

2. You get introduced to who you sound like. Write that down my Account management friends. If you talk about tactical and technical details, don't be surprised you are only allowed to talk to one department or user group.

3. Slow play and really invest in the relationship. Make sure you do 4-5 things for them before the ask.

4. Have names ready. Don't make people work for it. "I many times work with xyz group and saw Rachel Smith was the head of xyz at your company so thought it would be good... "

These four things will help you up your quality and quantity of contacts in all your current customers.

#sales #accountmanagement

```

### Template

```
How do I {{XXX}}??

Well for starters, {{XXX}}.

Next, you need to {{XXX}}.

Finally, {{XXX}}.

These steps are sure to help you {{XXX}}.

Have more questions about {{topic}}? Ask me anything in the comments!

```

### How It Works

- Provides immediate value by answering a common question
- Positions you as an expert in your field
- Creates opportunity for deeper engagement through follow-up questions
- Shows your willingness to help and share knowledge
- Often reveals what other questions your audience has

## 88. Welcome newbies or write a piece for beginners

### Description

Creating content specifically for newcomers to your industry or platform positions you as helpful and welcoming while serving an underrepresented audience.

### Example

```
PSA to all "newbies" here:

There are a lot of people, with big "followings" that are going to TELL you what you NEED and MUST do to be successful on LinkedIn.

Yes, online authenticity can be manufactured!

They mask this content with an altruistic hue, but there are hidden agendas to get you into their funnels/streams to warm you up to sell you a BS course.

Here are a couple of free tips:

1. You do you: focus on creating content around what you know well and feel passionate about. Do not feel obligated to post "feel good, rah rah" content be you see the big names doing it.

2. Be mindful of "influencers" followers and engagement. Lots of "hacks" out there and people paying (one way or another) to drive engagement metrics to boost their optics.

3. Test and learn, try new things (text, video, images)- see what resonates.

4. Be Patient- real, intentional & meaningful growth and networking takes time and effort.

Shortcuts = shortcomings

Just be yourself, have fun and don't stress out!
Nothing worthwhile comes easy...

```

### Template

```
Are you new here? Welcome! Here are a few pointers I wish someone told me when I first {{XXX}}:

1. Don't be intimidated by {{XXX}}. Because {{XXX}}.
2. Be mindful of {{XXX}}.
3. Don't worry about {{XXX}}.
4. {{XXX}} is not as important as you think.

Just have some fun! I promise we don't bite.

#hashtags

```

### How It Works

- Serves an often-overlooked audience of newcomers
- Positions you as helpful and welcoming
- Creates immediate value for beginners
- Often cuts through hype to provide genuine guidance
- Shows empathy for the challenges of starting out

## 89. Reveal Your Process to something in Bullets

### Description

Sharing your behind-the-scenes process creates transparency and provides valuable insights into how professionals really work.

### Example

```
My writing process revealed:
- 3 weeks before I'll write it
- 2 weeks before I blocked time to write it
- 1 week before I'll do it today
- Two days before. SHIT I really need to write this today.
- Day before. OK. I'm blocking an hour. Let's do this.

#marketing

```

### Template

```
Okay, fine. Enough gatekeeping. Here my strategy on {{XXX}}:

1. {{XXX}}
2. {{XXX}}
3. {{XXX}}
4. {{XXX}}

And not just on LinkedIn either.

## 94. Run a Salary Poll

Compensation is always a topic of high interest. Running an anonymous poll about salary ranges creates valuable data while driving significant engagement.

### Example

```
What do you feel is a fair salary range for a COO at a 10 Million Dollar revenue company in the USA with 50 employees?

[Poll with salary range options]

```

- Often generates follow-up discussion in comments
- Positions you as someone willing to bring transparency to taboo topics

## 95. Make a Sports Analogy

### Description

People love sports and can readily understand complex business concepts when framed through familiar sporting principles.

### Example

```
In boxing you want to stick and move
Throw a punch or a combination then move out of the way before you get hit.

Same idea in sales.
You'll always get punches/objections thrown at you.
The key is to counter with an answer and MOVE on.
Don't stand there waiting for the next punch.

There's a natural tendency for salespeople to answer a question and wait
for the next question or wait and see how the buyer reacts to their answer.

Whether you're cold calling or presenting, answer the question and keep it moving.

It's OK to get hit with objections from time to time, but as soon as you address them,
bring the convo back on track - finish the meeting strong and get to the next round.

You can tell a doctor to hurry up and finish the operation in 10 seconds, but the doctor won't even take you seriously.
Don't rush through your pitch or process or else the prospect won't take you seriously either.

#sales #toponepercenter #tips

```

### Template

```
In {{sport}}, {{describe a key principle or strategy from that sport}}

Same idea in {{your industry}}.

{{Draw the parallel between the sport and your business concept}}

## 97. Share a recent conversation you've had

### Description

Sharing real conversations (anonymized when appropriate) provides authentic insights while maintaining storytelling appeal.

### Example

```
4 days left in the Q. I said to my rep
"If Procurement comes back and asks for something else after this, I'm going to walk away. Are you ok with that?"
he said "Yes."

We went in with a creative and aggressive proposal. We added a little extra to give
Procurement a win, but Procurement knew we had 4 days left until our end of Q.

So Procurement asked for another discount. I finally said...

"We really gave you a great deal. We really want to do business with you, but not like this. I'm afraid we have to walk away."... "However"...
(always give it one last "However" before walking away)

"Please let the Business Unit know we would still honor the proposal on the table
for the remainder of the Q."

Then we walked away...

No communication for the rest of that day or the entire next day.

I knew 2 things:
1) The business needed our solution.
2) We gave them a great deal.

Two days left he called back.
Deal was done on the last day of the Q.

Not every deal will be the same, but every
deal should be a great deal for your customer.

Giving your buyer a great deal from the start will give you the confidence to
walk away from a bad negotiation and will
make the buyer realize how good of a deal they're getting.

#sales #toponepercenter #negociation

```

### Template

```
[Set up the conversation context]

[Share key dialogue from the conversation]

[Explain what happened as a result]

2) {{Second insight from the conversation}}

#hashtags

```

### How It Works

- Creates authenticity through real-world examples
- Shows your thinking process and decision-making
- Provides valuable lessons through storytelling
- Often addresses common professional scenarios
- Gives readers practical strategies they can apply

## 98. Call Out Something That Everyone is Thinking But Doesn't Say Out Loud

### Description

Being the person willing to voice common frustrations or observations that others hesitate to express publicly can create strong engagement and appreciation.

### Example

```
Stop calling meetings so you can simply organize your own thoughts with witnesses.

```

### Template

```
[Direct statement about a common workplace frustration or unspoken truth]

[Optional: Brief elaboration or humorous take on the situation]

#hashtags

```

### How It Works

- Creates immediate recognition and agreement
- Often generates significant engagement through shared frustration
- Positions you as courageous and authentic
- Can spark important conversations about workplace practices
- Sometimes uses humor to address sensitive topics

## Framework 5: The Sports Analogy

### Description

Using sports analogies makes complex business concepts immediately accessible through familiar principles and scenarios.

### Example

```
In boxing you want to stick and move. Throw a punch or a combination then move out of the way before you get hit.

Same idea in sales.

You'll always get punches/objections thrown at you. The key is to counter with an answer and MOVE on. Don't stand there waiting for the next punch.

There's a natural tendency for salespeople to answer a question and wait for the next question or wait and see how the buyer reacts to their answer.

Whether you're cold calling or presenting, answer the question and keep it moving.

```

### Template

```
In [sport], [describe a key principle or strategy from that sport]

Same idea in [your industry].

[Draw the parallel between the sport and your business concept]

[Provide specific guidance on how to apply this principle]

## Framework 7: The Real Conversation Share

### Description

Sharing actual conversations (with identifying details removed when appropriate) provides authentic insights while maintaining high storytelling appeal.

### Example

```
4 days left in the Q. I said to my rep
"If Procurement comes back and asks for something else after this, I'm going to walk away. Are you ok with that?"
he said "Yes."

We went in with a creative and aggressive proposal. We added a little extra to give Procurement a win, but Procurement knew we had 4 days left until our end of Q.

So Procurement asked for another discount. I finally said...

"We really gave you a great deal. We really want to do business with you, but not like this. I'm afraid we have to walk away."... "However"...
(always give it one last "However" before walking away)

"Please let the Business Unit know we would still honor the proposal on the table for the remainder of the Q."

Then we walked away...

No communication for the rest of that day or the entire next day.

I knew 2 things:
1) The business needed our solution.
2) We gave them a great deal.

Two days left he called back.
Deal was done on the last day of the Q.

Giving your buyer a great deal from the start will give you the confidence to walk away from a bad negotiation and will make the buyer realize how good of a deal they're getting.

```
