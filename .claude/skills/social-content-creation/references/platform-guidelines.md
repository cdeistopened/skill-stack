# Platform-Specific Guidelines

## LinkedIn

**Length:** Long-form value-dense posts outperform (200-500 words)

**Links:** Always in comments (not main post) - algorithm penalizes external links in main text

**Hashtags:** 3-5 maximum, minimal usage

**Voice:** Professional yet conversational, thought leadership tone

**Hook:** First 2 lines critical - shows in feed before "see more" button

**Structure:**
- Hook (2 lines max)
- Body (story, data, insights)
- Core insight or takeaway
- Question or CTA

**Tagging:** Tag mentioned people/organizations - increases reach and enables nearbound amplification

**Best Performing Formats:**
- Personal stories with business lessons
- Contrarian insights with data
- Pattern recognition posts
- "I've noticed..." observations
- Long-form educational threads

## X (Twitter)

**Length:** 70-100 characters optimal (despite 280 limit)

**Hashtags:** NONE

**Voice:** Witty, concise, to-the-point

**Threads:** Use for longer concepts - link to thread in main tweet

**Current Strategy:** Reply game until 500-1000 followers (posting has low ROI currently)

**Thread Best Practices:**
- Hook in first tweet
- 3-7 tweets ideal length
- One idea per tweet
- Visual pattern (bullets, numbers, breaks)
- CTA or question in final tweet

**Best Performing Formats:**
- Hot takes (contrarian but obvious)
- Quick tips (numbered lists)
- Before/After comparisons
- Quote tweets with added perspective

## Facebook

**Length:** 40-140 characters optimal

**Links:** NO external links in main post (kills organic reach)
- Share link in first comment instead
- Or use Stories with link stickers

**Hashtags:** NO hashtags (Facebook doesn't reward them, looks spammy)

**Voice:** Informal, playful, personable

**Format:** Question posts with background images perform best

**Content Mix:** 80% category content, 20% program/brand promotion

**Best Performing Formats:**
- Question posts (genuine curiosity, not rhetorical)
- Community conversation starters
- "Tag someone who..." posts
- Personal stories (relatable moments)
