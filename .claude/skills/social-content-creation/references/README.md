## Progressive Disclosure Principle

Main SKILL.md contains:
- Core workflow (4 phases)
- When to use each method
- Quality checks
- Critical principles

References contain:
- Detailed templates and examples
- Platform-specific rules
- Proliferation method details

This follows Anthropic's progressive disclosure design: keep SKILL.md lean (<5k words), move detailed reference material to separate files.
