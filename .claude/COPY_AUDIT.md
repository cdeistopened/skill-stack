# Skill Stack Copy Audit

> Testing all copy through the lens of "Sarah the Solopreneur"

---

## Current Copy Inventory

### 1. Homepage Hero (Home.tsx + siteConfig)

| Element | Current Copy | Sarah's Reaction |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Title** | "Skill Stack" | Neutral — doesn't tell her what it is |
| **Subtitle** | "The meta-skill for the AI age" | Too abstract — "what's a meta-skill?" |
| **Intro** | "Learn to write with AI—not like AI. Master the skills that turn you into a cyborg writer..." | Better — speaks to her fear of generic AI writing |
| **Bio** | "Stack skills. Ship faster. A newsletter about building with AI." | Good rhythm, but "stack skills" is jargon |

**A/B Test Ideas:**
- **A (Current)**: "The meta-skill for the AI age"
- **B (Benefit-led)**: "Write faster without losing your voice"
- **C (Pain-led)**: "Stop sounding like ChatGPT wrote it"

---

### 2. Newsletter Signup CTAs (siteConfig.newsletter.signup)

| Location | Title | Description | Sarah's Take |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Home** | "Stay Updated" | "Get new posts delivered to your inbox." | Generic — doesn't promise value |
| **Blog page** | "Subscribe" | "Get notified when new posts are published." | Same issue — what's in it for her? |
| **Posts** | "Enjoyed this post?" | "Subscribe for more updates." | Warm but vague |

**A/B Test Ideas:**

**Home signup:**
- **A (Current)**: "Stay Updated" / "Get new posts delivered..."
- **B (Skill promise)**: "Learn a new AI skill every week" / "5-minute reads that upgrade your workflow"
- **C (FOMO)**: "Join 500+ writers leveling up" / "Don't fall behind on AI writing"

**Post signup:**
- **A (Current)**: "Enjoyed this post?" / "Subscribe for more updates"
- **B (Next step)**: "Want more like this?" / "Get the next skill delivered to your inbox"
- **C (Exclusive)**: "Get the full skill library" / "Subscribers get access to premium SKILL.md files"

---

### 3. Blog Page (siteConfig.blogPage)

| Element | Current | Sarah's Take |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Title** | "Blog" | Fine but generic |
| **Description** | "All posts from the blog, sorted by date." | Purely functional — no hook |

**A/B Test Ideas:**
- **A (Current)**: "Blog" / "All posts from the blog, sorted by date."
- **B (Skills framing)**: "The Skill Library" / "Practical AI writing techniques you can use today"
- **C (Journey framing)**: "Start Here" / "From AI-curious to AI-confident"

---

### 4. Contact Form (siteConfig.contactForm)

| Element | Current | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Title** | "Get in Touch" | Standard |
| **Description** | "Send us a message and we'll get back to you." | Passive |

**A/B Test Ideas:**
- **A (Current)**: "Get in Touch" / "Send us a message..."
- **B (Conversation)**: "Let's Talk" / "Have a question about AI writing? I respond to every email."
- **C (Help-oriented)**: "Stuck on Something?" / "Describe your AI writing challenge and I'll point you to the right skill."

---

### 5. Footer (siteConfig.footer.defaultContent)

**Current**: "Built by Charlie Deist. Follow on Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and GitHub."

**Sarah's reaction**: Fine, but doesn't add value.

**Alternative ideas:**
- "Charlie Deist writes about AI for content creators. He raises chickens, kids, and his game—in that order."
- "Questions? Reply to any newsletter email. I read them all."

## Copy Principles for Skill Stack

Based on Sarah's needs:

### DO:
1. **Lead with the outcome**, not the feature ("Write faster" > "AI skills")
2. **Acknowledge the fear** — she worries about sounding like AI
3. **Emphasize speed** — she's time-starved
4. **Use "you" language** — make it personal
5. **Be specific** — "5-minute skills" beats "quick reads"

### DON'T:
1. Use jargon without explanation ("meta-skill", "stack skills")
2. Sound like every other AI newsletter ("transform your workflow!")
3. Overpromise ("10x your output!")
4. Be vague about what she'll get

---

## Priority Changes

### Quick Wins (change in siteConfig):
1. **Newsletter home title**: "Stay Updated" → "Get a new AI skill every week"
2. **Newsletter home description**: → "5-minute techniques that make your writing faster and better."
3. **Blog description**: → "Practical AI writing skills you can use today."

### Medium Effort (Home.tsx):
1. Test new subtitle in hero section
2. Add social proof once we have subscriber numbers

### Longer Term:
1. Create dedicated landing page for newsletter signup
2. Add testimonials/case studies from early readers
3. Build "Start Here" guided path for new visitors
