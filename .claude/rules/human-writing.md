# Human Writing Skill

Transform AI-assisted drafts into authentic, distinctive prose. This skill combines anti-AI pattern detection, voice adaptation, and Charlie Deist's signature writing moves into a single comprehensive system.

## When to Use

- Reviewing and humanizing AI-generated drafts
- Writing content that must not appear AI-assisted
- Converting transcripts or source material into polished prose
- Maintaining a distinctive personal voice across content

## Part 1: The Forbidden Patterns (AI Tells)

These patterns consistently signal AI involvement. Eliminate them aggressively.

### The Correlative Construction (The #1 AI Tell)

- "X aren't just Y - they're Z"
- "X isn't just about Y, it's about Z"
- "Teachers aren't just instructors - they're mentors"

**Why it's bad:** This is the default structure AI models produce. Every AI writing sample uses this.

**Better:** State the point directly. "Teachers mentor students."

### Forbidden Constructions

- "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- "The truth is..." / "The reality is..."
- "Let that sink in"
- "Now more than ever..."

### Forbidden Rhetorical Flourishes

- "The best part? ..."
- "The secret? ..."
- "Sounds impossible? It's not."
- "What if I told you..."
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's be honest..."
- "At the end of the day..."

### Forbidden Staccato Phrasing

Do not use faux-dramatic sentence fragments:
- "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
- "Big ideas. Small words. Maximum impact."
- "Simple. Clear. Effective."

### Forbidden Openers

- "In the ever-evolving world of..."
- "In today's fast-paced..."
- "Gone are the days when..."
- "In an era where..."

### Formatting Rules

- No boldface for emphasis in body text
- No emojis unless explicitly requested
- No summaries like "In conclusion" or "In summary"
- Use hyphens with spaces - like this - not em dashes

## Part 2: Anti-AI Pattern Detection

### Overuse of "Just" and "Actually"

**Problem:** AI uses these as softeners and nuance-signals.

- Bad: "We just need to understand that it's just about learning"
- Good: "It's about learning. Focus on what matters."

**Limit:** Once per 500 words maximum for "actually"

### Hedging Language

AI loves hedge words because they make uncertain claims safer. But they make writing weak.

**Remove these:**
- "might" / "could" / "perhaps" / "possibly" / "maybe"
- "Some people say..." -> "I've found that..."
- "It could be argued..." -> "It's true that..."
- "One could say..." -> "This is true because..."

**Test:** Do I actually believe this? If yes, remove the hedge.

### Passive Voice

- Bad: "It was determined that improvements were needed"
- Good: "We need to improve"

**Test:** If you can't identify who's doing the action, rewrite it.

### Corporate Jargon

- Bad: "Leveraging synergies across stakeholder ecosystems"
- Good: "Getting different people talking to each other"

**Test:** Would you say this to a friend?

### Vague Language

- Bad: "Our users improve"
- Good: "Users improve by 40% in 6 months"

**Test:** Can you back it up with a specific number, example, or name?

### Too Many Transitions

**Limit transitions to:** but, and, so, then, because

Remove: furthermore, moreover, additionally, it's important to note that...

## Part 3: Charlie Deist's Signature Moves

### 1. The Aphoristic Opening

Thesis statements disguised as proverbs:
- "A vigorous life is the best training for a 50-mile march, and a 50-mile march is the best training for a vigorous life."
- "First you create your environment; then your environment creates you."

### 2. The Personal-to-Universal Bridge

1. Start with a specific personal moment
2. Expand to cultural/historical commentary
3. Return to the personal with new meaning

### 3. The Intellectual Name-Drop (Earned)

Reference thinkers (Ivan Illich, Ray Peat, Georges Hebert) only when directly relevant. Not showing off - building a coalition. Always explain why the reference matters.

### 4. The Contrarian Hook

Challenge received wisdom without becoming edgelord:
- "In 99% of cases of chronic sedentarism, the inactive person is not lazy. They're bored."

### 5. The Incarnational Detail

Specific, sensory, grounding:
- RFK walking in "leather Oxford dress shoes"
- "cut-off jeans, brightly colored Bermuda shorts, sweat suits, old football jerseys"

### 6. The Self-Deprecating Confession

Prevents preachiness; builds trust:
- "I write this admonition as someone who often scrolls Twitter on the couch"
- "The spirit is willing, but the ankles are weak"

---

## Part 4: Sentence-Level Rules

### DO:
- Use concrete verbs over abstract ones ("walked" not "proceeded")
- Vary sentence length dramatically - long flowing sentences punctuated by short punches
- Use em-dashes liberally for parenthetical asides and dramatic pauses
- Quote primary sources at length when they're genuinely excellent
- Use "you" to address the reader directly
- End sections with forward-leaning statements that create momentum

### DON'T:
- Use jargon without explanation
- Lecture - earn the right to instruct through story first
- Use "we" falsely (don't claim solidarity you haven't earned)
- Stack adjectives ("incredible, amazing, transformative journey")
- End chapters with summary bullets
- Use exclamation points except in quoted speech

---

## Part 5: Sticky Sentences

Use these techniques to create memorable statements:

**Alliteration** - Same starting sounds
- "Specificity is the secret"
- "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed"

**Symmetry** - Parallel structure
- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations."

**Contrast** - Opposing ideas
- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere."
- "Be clear, not clever. Concise, not complex."

**Rhyme** - Similar ending sounds
- "Tell a story or lose your glory"

**Rhythm** - Pleasing cadence
- "When you can't wait to share it, they can't help but read it"

**For maximum stickiness, combine techniques:**
- "Anger prepares us to fight. Fear prepares us to flee." (Symmetry + Alliteration)

---

## Part 6: The SUCKS Framework

Before writing anything, answer these questions:

**S - Specific**
- Write for ONE person, not a crowd
- If you write for everyone, you write for no one

**U - Unique & Useful**
- Does this change how your reader thinks, feels, or acts?

**C - Clear, Curious, Conversational**
- Main idea is unmissable
- Reads like talking to a friend

**K - Kept Simple & Structured**
- Simple ideas, simple words
- Clear beginning, middle, end

**S - Sticky**
- Memorable phrases they'll repeat

## Part 7: Tone Calibration

### The Spectrum:
```
[Too Soft] -------- [Target Zone] -------- [Too Hard]
     |                     |                     |
Self-help pablum    Earned authority      Drill sergeant
Passive voice       Active, direct        Contemptuous
Apologetic          Confident            Preachy
"Maybe consider..." "Do this."           "You're pathetic if..."
```

### Target Tone:
- A coach who has done the thing and believes you can too
- A friend who tells you the truth because he respects you
- A historian who sees you in the context of something larger
- A fellow traveler, slightly ahead on the path

---

## Part 8: The Humanization Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Your Source
- What's the core insight or story?
- What's the emotional arc?
- What's the 30-second version?

### Step 2: Apply SUCKS Framework
- Who is my ONE reader?
- Is this unique and useful?
- Clear, curious, conversational?
- Simple and structured?
- What will stick?

### Step 3: Write or Edit
If editing AI output: Rewrite rather than patch. Identify the core message and reconstruct.

### Step 4: Apply Sticky Sentences
Identify 2-3 most important statements. Add alliteration, symmetry, contrast, or rhythm.

### Step 5: Eliminate AI Tells
Scan systematically:
- [ ] Correlative constructions
- [ ] Overuse of "just" and "actually"
- [ ] Hedge words
- [ ] Passive voice
- [ ] Corporate jargon
- [ ] Vague language
- [ ] Forbidden patterns
- [ ] Too many transitions

### Step 6: Read Aloud
- Does it sound like a real person talking?
- Does energy transfer (conversation, not lecture)?
- Is every sentence earning its place?
- Are there obvious AI tells remaining?

## The Final Test

Before considering any piece complete, ask:

1. Does it tell a story that resolves?
2. Does it give the reader something actionable?
3. Does it sound like Charlie Deist wrote it?
4. Would I want to read the next section?
5. **Would this sentence appear in a ChatGPT output? If yes, rewrite it.**

## Quick Reference: The AI Tell Scan

Before publishing, scan for:
- [ ] "It's not X, it's Y" constructions
- [ ] "Just" appearing more than once
- [ ] "Actually" as sentence filler
- [ ] Passive voice
- [ ] Hedge words
- [ ] Corporate speak
- [ ] Vague claims without specifics
- [ ] Overused transitions
- [ ] Complex sentences that could be simple
- [ ] Rhetorical flourishes ("The best part?")
