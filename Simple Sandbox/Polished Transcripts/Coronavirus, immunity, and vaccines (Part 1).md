# Politics & Science: Coronavirus, Immunity, and Vaccines (Part 1)
**Politics & Science** | Date Unknown | Dr. Raymond Peat

---

## Introduction and Welcome
*show-overview, guest-introduction, topic-announcement*

**John Barkhousen:** All right, you're listening to WMRW LP Warren. It's five o'clock in time for Politics and Science. Politics and Science is live today for a change, and I'm very honored to have Dr. Raymond Peat back on the line here in the studio. Let me use the same bio I had for you years ago.

You have a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology. I also consider you a science historian and ombudsman. I've added that, and if you want to correct that, please feel free.

**Dr. Peat:** Okay.

**John Barkhousen:** All right, well, I've wanted to get you on again because you're interesting to hear on any subject. We particularly have this weird emergency going on that I think has got everybody spinning—the so-called Corona 19, or what's it called, COVID-19 pandemic. I just wanted to get your take on that, and then maybe we could talk about the science behind pandemics and viruses and all of that, and maybe cover vaccines at the end. So feel free to just jump in. What do you think is going on right now?

## Current Coronavirus Situation vs. Historical Data
*virus-statistics, respiratory-disease, pandemic-analysis*

**Dr. Peat:** First of all, I'm not sure anything special is going on in the virus and infection world. It's definitely happening in the media and politics. Mexico isn't getting excited, and they've had I think 16 mild cases. But the CDC for years has been reporting the annual respiratory or flu-like death rate as being in the tens of thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The average number of deaths from respiratory disease is about 30 or 40,000. If you look at the historic percentage of those respiratory diseases, about 10% of them—roughly from 5 to 15%—are historically coronavirus infections. The others are things as simple as rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus, ranging from mild sniffles up to serious pneumonia.

Historically, about 10% are corona-type virus. So if 30 or 40,000 people are expected to die from flu-like respiratory disease, we would expect to have 3,000 or 4,000 deaths per year from a coronavirus respiratory infection. I don't see any evidence at all that anything is happening on the real biological level. Are you there? The line seems to have—

**John Barkhousen:** Sorry, Ray. That was my fault. Do you hear me now? Yes, I was just saying that the official line is that the crisis actually hasn't happened yet. But you're saying in a given year we should still see 3,000 to 4,000 deaths from coronavirus.

**Dr. Peat:** In an average year that could still happen. We could get up to the average mortality associated with coronaviruses, but we're not approaching that by a long way so far. It's a lower than average year as far as the actual figures that exist indicate. Just looking at the actual numbers, it looks like we're slightly deficient in cases and deaths of respiratory problems associated with that virus.

**John Barkhousen:** And that's looking at the historical data.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah.

**John Barkhousen:** Have you checked out the Chinese or Asian data at this point? Are corona deaths up from their average?

**Dr. Peat:** They haven't talked about the average for corona. They weren't gathering that data. But they say this is just slightly more deadly than a typical influenza virus or the other things causing respiratory disease.

It is somewhat, according to their figures, just slightly more deadly. But the problem is Italy always has had about twice as many respiratory or flu-like deaths per year per capita as the United States. So it isn't unusual for them to be especially hard hit.

What makes the number go up is that they have been primarily testing sick people in hospitals. If you really, really dig deep looking for something, you'll find it. It's the same with cancer diagnosis. If you go all out to look for cancer in a population of middle-aged and old people, you'll find 100% cancer if you're really thorough in your diagnosis.

The more you diagnose, the more you can find people. People die at the same rate unless you treat them. If you increase your treatment for cancer as you increase the diagnosis, the treatment is going to kill more and more. But you can make your treatments look better by diagnosing more and more cases which are harmless.

Same with the flu or the coronavirus. If you test everyone in the population, you'll get all these people with very mild reactions. In South Korea, for example, they got 0.6% because they tested more people. When you test a more representative cross-section of the population, the dying people become a smaller percentage.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. So maybe it's just an accident that because they're looking for the disease in the most vulnerable, they test the sickest people first.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. If you restrict testing to people in the hospital on respirators, you'll find that most of them have serious viruses, probably multiple respiratory viruses.

**John Barkhousen:** I see.

**Dr. Peat:** When you're very sick, various viruses that have been carried harmlessly will pop to the surface and get measured.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. Because your immune system is compromised.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah.

## Understanding Viruses and Bacteria
*virus-definition, bacterial-biology, infection-mechanisms*

**John Barkhousen:** Now, if we could back up a little bit—because I am confused, and probably other people are too—what's the difference between a virus and a bacteria? Also, what is particular about the coronavirus?

**Dr. Peat:** Almost all bacteria are free-living in a sense. They can generally live outside of cells if you feed them the right stuff and give them the right temperature and other conditions. They have the apparatus to reproduce their own genetic material.

The virus, on the other hand, depends on entering a cell—either a bacterium or a higher organism's cell—and taking advantage of their machinery, like ribosomes that can produce proteins from nucleic acids. These viruses put in their nucleic acid once they can get into the cell. That is processed on our ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and proteins are added to the replicated nucleic acid. Then it's excreted as a finished particle by our ordinary cell secretory system.

## Immune System Defense Mechanisms
*immune-response, surfactant-protein, ace2-receptor*

**John Barkhousen:** So in a healthy person, if you encounter a virus—even if it's a new virus that nobody's seen—do you think we're able to conquer that or at least isolate it so it doesn't do any harm?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. On the respiratory surface in our lungs and the tubes leading into the air sacs, the air sacs are lined with epithelial cells that can secrete. There are cells around the air sac that secrete mucus to cover the epithelial cells and to reduce the surface tension so the air sac will stay open.

There's a protein called surfactant protein that has an oily-loving, lipophilic fraction, so it acts like a soap. The water-loving part of the protein dissolves in this mucous layer on the cell lining the air sac. The oily surface reduces the surface tension so the air sac can stay open without extreme tension.

That surfactant protein contains groups that will collect the sugar-like surfaces of viral proteins. Any pathogen that hits that surfactant protein will get glued down by these binding particles. So it's our first layer of defense.

In and around the epithelial layer, we have reactive parts of the immune system. The angiotensin-converting enzyme is one of the early parts of our immune system that sets up an inflammatory reaction that will set in action a whole chain of events.

If the pathogen gets through and is actually a threat, you activate this proteolytic protein that creates angiotensin, which is like a transmitter of a panic reaction to the organism. This coronavirus is able to bind to one of these angiotensin-converting enzymes.

There is one which is only pro-inflammatory, and another one that backs that up, which inhibits the inflammatory damage done by the first angiotensin-producing enzyme. This is called ACE2. ACE2 happens to be attacked by this particular virus, which binds to that enzyme. That's called the receptor—it's a vulnerable point of the organism as far as this virus is concerned.

Binding to ACE2 means it leaves ACE1 free to act. ACE1 produces angiotensin, but ACE2 is capable of inactivating angiotensin, breaking it down to the first seven amino acids—they call it angiotensin 1-7. This is a defensive, anti-inflammatory peptide.

If your ACE2 is knocked out, angiotensin has a free range to cause damage. The virus increases the inflammatory reaction by sticking to this defensive enzyme. That enzyme combined with the virus then acts to enter the cell by way of the angiotensin receptor, which is called the AT1.

There are two known receptors by which angiotensin can do its damage. Angiotensin I is strictly an inflammation-producing system. Angiotensin II produces some somewhat defensive reactions. But it happens that the virus-enzyme combination enters the cell by way of angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1).

That turns on a whole range of destructive processes—nitric oxide and serotonin, for example. Just looking at the effects, it's obvious that you could defend by anything that defends you against nitric oxide and serotonin.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. Which are inflammatory mediators.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. Anti-inflammatory things are the known treatment for this kind of virus. The Chinese for years have been using cinanserin, which is a serotonin blocker, for other treatments. They find that it's helpful for people with established respiratory corona infection.

**John Barkhousen:** And what was the name of that again, Ray?

**Dr. Peat:** Cinanserin. C-I-N-A-N-S-E-R-I-N. And Losartan, which is a high blood pressure drug, is the most well-known blocker of angiotensin 1 receptor. There are several others, but Losartan is cheap and widely available.

**John Barkhousen:** How do you spell that?

**Dr. Peat:** L-O-S-A-R-T-A-N. Just like it sounds.

**John Barkhousen:** And what did you call that drug, Ray?

**Dr. Peat:** It's an angiotensin 1 receptor blocker.

**John Barkhousen:** Okay, it's quite an action film you just painted for us there. I could follow it all, but it seemed pretty intricate.

## Antiviral Protection: Aspirin, Vitamin D, and Other Treatments
*antiviral-agents, aspirin-benefits, immune-support*

**Dr. Peat:** Basically, the virus just activates an inflammatory process that many other things activate. Things that would primarily activate nitric oxide production, serotonin production, histamine, or prostaglandin production tend to end up in the same condition.

I think without knowing more about the nature of the infection, people who are taking aspirin, for example, it has a wide range of antiviral properties. It's already known to reduce infection from the standard influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, rhinovirus. Half a dozen well-known viruses are blocked by common aspirin. There was even a study of HIV in which they saw beneficial effects from aspirin.

**John Barkhousen:** Well, that's certainly available and very cheap.

**Dr. Peat:** Although much maligned, vitamin D happens to have one of its effects like progesterone and aspirin. All of our known protective, pro-immune but anti-inflammatory things lower the expression of angiotensin receptor 1. So they predispose us to be less inflammable.

**John Barkhousen:** So it sounded like when you say that the virus enters your lungs, your cells put out a kind of lipid of some kind.

**Dr. Peat:** Well, naturally, once we're born and start breathing, we depend on the production of this surfactant protein. So it's everywhere normally. Our intestines have similar layers of defenses. Right at the very surface, mucus will be a barrier against infection.

Then at the surface there are layers of cells and so on. These viruses, the coronaviruses, don't just specialize on the lungs. They can infect the mucous membranes in the nose and the intestine. Some people have been saying that runny noses aren't connected as a precursor of the lung infection. But a Russian virologist says that looking at tens of thousands of patients, he saw that a runny nose was a typical precursor to the rest of the lung infection symptoms. The intestine is just as prone to infection as the lungs.

**John Barkhousen:** So eating something could make you sick if you're feeling weak. I don't know if that's true, but it's possible to eat the virus and it could attack your intestines, is that what you're saying?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. If you get it in your mouth and swallow it, it could infect those membranes as well.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. Even though your stomach acid you'd think would take care of it.

**Dr. Peat:** Not necessarily. The stomach acid doesn't break down the nucleic acid.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. If you're a healthy person, the mucus, I understand, is often a protective layer. I think you just said that. If your mucus is healthy and working correctly, would it be able to kill the virus? Or is this virus just too much for it?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. The surface cells, including the mucus, have proteins analogous to the surfactant in the lung—proteins that collect the surface groups of a pathogen and bind them together. It's just like putting flypaper on them, sort of.

**John Barkhousen:** Oh, right. I was thinking it sounded like soap. You said it was soap-like.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. The hydrophobic surface itself tends to disorganize some of the invaders.

## Hand Washing and the Power of Soap
*hand-hygiene, soap-mechanism, viral-destruction*

**John Barkhousen:** For instance, they're telling us to wash our hands all the time. How does soap kill a virus? Do you know?

**Dr. Peat:** Soap works by taking the proteins and dissolving them, making relatively insoluble things soluble. Soap has that hydrophobic fraction that sticks to hydrophobic insoluble parts of an organism and disassembles it from inside out.

**John Barkhousen:** Right. So that's a good thing. Now, is COVID-19 a little better at breaking into our system than a normal cold? I've heard a cold is also a coronavirus. Is that true?

**Dr. Peat:** A cold can be caused by any of these. If your immune system is good, like, one study found that almost half of all respiratory infections couldn't identify a particular cause. But rhinovirus was the biggest at about 30%—that's the most common cold virus that is identified.

But there are lots of unknown things that cause those symptoms. The coronavirus is in the range of somewhere between 5 and 15% of those respiratory infections.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. Do you think the reaction of the government at this point is over the top, considering?

## Government Response and Political Context
*pandemic-response, political-interests, sanctions*

**Dr. Peat:** Unless it was their purpose to create international chaos—for example, to try to finish off Iran by cutting off their medical supplies while they're having a crisis.

**John Barkhousen:** That's right. The Trump administration is intensifying the sanctions at this point.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. You would suppose that it would fit into their plans. And if it's not really a threat otherwise, it becomes a threat when you do all of these insane things. For example, I just learned that all of my favorite brands of milk have been discontinued for the duration of the panic.

**John Barkhousen:** Really? I hadn't. Why is that?

**Dr. Peat:** I don't know.

**John Barkhousen:** Are they claiming milk is a carrier?

**Dr. Peat:** No, no. But I have noticed that over the last several weeks, the Lucerne brand that I normally get—they reduced it to one little row in the supermarket and weren't replenishing that. But then today they said they were discontinuing it.

**John Barkhousen:** Wow, that's annoying. Well, worse than annoying because you don't have any milk. Yeah, I'm sort of puzzled by the reaction, and everybody around here is trying to cope with it.

## Vaccine Development, Patents, and Conflicts of Interest
*vaccine-development, patent-systems, cdc-conflicts, who-conflicts*

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, the media, including the big science media like Nature and International Science Magazine, are getting kind of excited in denying that it was an intentionally created virus that was leaked either accidentally or intentionally. They just, I think yesterday, published a paper explaining technically why it would be impossible for them to have done it.

But the fact that they're rushing so fast to deny that it could have been leaked accidentally out of a lab is telling. When you look at the fact that normally they say it takes over a year to produce a vaccine to a new respiratory infection, but they're already now within weeks saying that they have a vaccine ready to test.

The purpose of the CDC patenting the coronavirus 17 years ago was deliberately to create pathogens experimentally to enable them to anticipate pathogens so that they could create a vaccine ready. Their intention was to have a vaccine ready by creating a pathogen. But now they're saying they couldn't possibly have created this. Yet they do happen to have a vaccine almost ready to use. By their own declarations, it sounds very suspicious.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. I feel like there's a tremendous conflict of interest at the CDC. I know we're supposed to respect them.

**Dr. Peat:** Yes. Same as the World Health Organization. The head of that on January 29 said it's not a pandemic. And then the next day he said it is a pandemic. I think something happened to him politically.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. A pandemic was supposed to reach a much higher bar, as my understanding is, than we've reached at this point.

**Dr. Peat:** Well, as I said, I don't see any evidence that it's anything different from last year or 10 years ago.

**John Barkhousen:** Maybe you could explain the conflict of interest at the World Health Organization. I'm not familiar with that.

**Dr. Peat:** People working there who have close connections to the vaccine industry. I think Robert Kennedy Jr.'s website has information about the conflicts of interest.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, he's spoken quite eloquently about that. You mentioned that the CDC has a patent on the coronavirus. Why would they patent that?

**Dr. Peat:** Well, so they can license a vaccine, I suppose.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. That gives them the right—the sole right—to licensing a vaccine that would treat that. Trump's Dr. Fauci—F-A-U-C-I. I've heard him speak. He actually seems like a fairly straightforward person. He was saying it would be at least a year and a half, minimum, to put out a vaccine. Do you think he's just out of the loop?

**Dr. Peat:** No, no. That's what they've been saying. Virologists in general say it takes time to develop it and to do actual testing. I think that's a very optimistic idea because if they really had to test it, you know, it would take a generation.

**John Barkhousen:** Because they tested on animals.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. The way they have tested the safety of it, for example, is to use the same adjuvant in the control group—an aluminum adjuvant, for example, which is the most dangerous component. So they're using fraudulent safety tests. You can't have a test without a control group.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. The control group is being fed the same adjuvant, which is actually. Explain what an adjuvant is, Ray. You'll do it much better than I will.

## Adjuvants and Vaccine Safety Testing
*vaccine-adjuvants, aluminum-oxide, immunological-storm*

**Dr. Peat:** It creates derangement of the muscle tissue where they inject it. Anything that you inject into the muscle is going to damage it and start an immune corrective process. They found that just pathogen particles weren't enough to really tear up the tissue to produce a violent immune reaction.

So they found that aluminum oxide particles created a terrific immunological storm that would sometimes create a little tumor or abscess at the site. It was such an intense damage that the extreme inflammation at the point of injection activates a better, more systemic immune reaction. It turns your whole body into an inflammatory system. People very, very often have a fever for a couple of days after getting a shot.

**John Barkhousen:** So that's why some people, when they get a flu shot, feel like they have a mild flu.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, it's the same thing. It's a systemic inflammatory reaction, which is the whole purpose of the adjuvant. It wouldn't be an adjuvant if it didn't damage your inflammatory system.

**John Barkhousen:** So you're saying when they do the testing, they don't have a control group that doesn't receive the adjuvant?

**Dr. Peat:** In many of the studies, that isn't a universal situation, but several of the very important studies were completely fraudulent by not having a control group.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, I think that's considered standard in double-blind testing, isn't it?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah.

## Spanish Flu, Vaccine History, and Wartime Epidemics
*spanish-flu, vaccine-history, 1918-pandemic, war-conditions*

**John Barkhousen:** I have a number of questions here, but maybe we should talk a little bit more about vaccines. They keep referencing the so-called Spanish flu from 1918, which took a tremendous toll on lives over a year or two. It was blamed on Spain, like Trump is blaming this on China. But it turned out it actually came from a U.S. army base.

I just read recently that the so-called flu that started at the army base for soldiers who had just been drafted and then were shipped over to Europe might have been caused by a vaccine that the Rockefeller Center was testing on those soldiers who were basically draftees. Have you heard anything about that? And I was wondering if you could talk about that.

**Dr. Peat:** I haven't heard any more than what you said, but do you know about the movie Vaxed?

**John Barkhousen:** Yes, I do.

**Dr. Peat:** There's information in that about the Gulf War Syndrome and the anthrax vaccine. People were getting Gulf War Syndrome without leaving the US, following their anthrax vaccination.

**John Barkhousen:** That's right. I think there were a lot of complaints by veterans about those vaccines and also the nurses who were giving them, who felt terrible about administering them. I'm just going to read a little bit here about an article from lewrockwell.com about research on the Spanish flu. This scientist looked at autopsies of people who supposedly died of the flu, and they all tested positive for bacterial pneumonia. For some reason they all got bacterial pneumonia. This person believes that's what killed them, and that's different than the flu.

**Dr. Peat:** Oh, definitely. But the CDC counts pretty much what would fall into the unknown category of severe respiratory syndromes. They get their annual 40 or 50,000 deaths that they can scare people by saying that's flu. "Get your flu shot." Obviously, it isn't the flu.

It's pneumonia from partly unknown causes and partly a variety of viruses that have nothing to do with the flu shot. The reality is the statistics are misleading.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. And of course, veterans in that situation are in the worst environment because they're either packed into barracks or into ships being shipped to Europe or in trenches where it's very.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. The conditions during the First World War were not healthful in general. Much of the world was influenced by the war conditions. Stress itself is the cause of epidemics. Shortage of food will increase the incidence of infectious diseases.

## Stress, Economic Disruption, and Epidemics
*stress-epidemiology, food-shortage, unemployment-disease*

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, that's a really good point. So I mean right now, if it's true that this is a pandemic, it seems to mean that people all around the world are under a tremendous amount of stress if they're succumbing to it. Do you think that's possibly a cause? If it actually is the case that we're succumbing?

**Dr. Peat:** If anything unusual is happening in the disease world, I think you can blame sanctions as one of the big causes. It's dislocating the world economy. If you cause unemployment, you're going to increase infectious diseases.

**John Barkhousen:** I mean, poverty causes infectious diseases and causes ill health. And somebody else was speculating that all the places where the hot spots for this viral infection are also coincide with sites of 5G deployment—the new telecommunications standard that involves a lot more millimeter waves basically being everywhere in the environment so you can't escape these microwaves. Do you think that could contribute to declining immune system?

## 5G and Electromagnetic Effects on Immunity
*5g-technology, electromagnetic-radiation, immune-degradation*

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, I saw a good tape—an hour-long lecture by Deborah Davis, who did a good book on cancer, The Phony War on Cancer. This is a very good analysis of the electromagnetic damage. Mostly they're claiming that it's safe on the basis of absolutely no research. But the animal research that exists shows that there is a real danger.

**John Barkhousen:** There is a degradation of the immune system from, like, cell phones, for instance.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. For example, some studies show that just the mild field from sitting at an electric sewing machine—they found that people who worked on an electric sewing machine for 20 years had a very high rate of dementia. Anything that affects your nervous system is affecting your immune system.

**John Barkhousen:** Right. So another reason to go back to a treadle sewing machine and a bicycle. That's right. I'm going to switch and go to some questions here, Ray. Some people have nicely sent in questions for you tonight. I think mostly about this topic. So I'll proceed with that. Here's Caleb from Ontario, Canada. He would like to ask how much of a role endotoxin plays in regards to a viral infection. Does the effect of endotoxin increase in the presence of a virus? And maybe you could quickly tell everybody what endotoxin is.

## Endotoxin and Intestinal Barrier Function
*endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide, bacterial-permeability, intestinal-health*

**Dr. Peat:** Endotoxin is a fatty acid with carbohydrate attached to it—it's called lipopolysaccharide. It's just part of the coating of a bacterium, so it's being produced in the living process of the bacteria.

Normally, our intestine filters out most of it. But when you're under stress, more of it reaches your liver, and your liver is always doing a fairly good job of detoxifying it. But some of it's always circulating and activating the immune system a little bit.

When you're under stress, your liver gets overwhelmed with this bacterial material and lets it produce inflammation and stress, interfering with oxidative metabolism everywhere in your body. It's activating because it interferes with mitochondrial energy production.

It's overlapping with what the angiotensin system is doing anyway. But it activates the angiotensin system. So viral infection and anything stressing your intestine enough to make it permeable to bacterial materials will end up in the same place, making you have inflammatory symptoms—sometimes with bowel-centered symptoms, other times lung and head-centered symptoms.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. It's always amazed me. I didn't believe you years ago when I first heard you talk about the intestine being so connected to your other organs. But I do believe you now. If you look at a map of the nerve system, your intestines are connected to all those organs.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. It's partly chemical leaking through and partly inflammatory substances like serotonin and histamine produced by the intestine itself getting into the bloodstream. A tremendous flood of serotonin shows up and circulates in the platelets, and the nerves directly can transmit signals such as secretion of mucus and production of histamine, serotonin, and nitric oxide right up in your nose membranes and throat membranes.

So you can treat the symptoms at the source by swallowing these things. That's why I recommend raw carrot, because carrot being indigestible will help wash out some of the bacteria that are producing the endotoxin. If you take anti-inflammatory things with it, such as olive or coconut oil, or aspirin, or an antihistamine, or antibiotic, the carrot will deliver that down all the way through your intestine, offering protection and anti-inflammatory effect.

**John Barkhousen:** Oh, go ahead.

**Dr. Peat:** An early 20th-century gastroenterologist demonstrated that canine distemper, which was thought of as a lung and respiratory disease, was actually starting in the intestine. He found that before any bacteria or any virus occurred in any of these respiratory membranes, there was already a well-established infection in the intestine.

Animals would start drooling and sniffling because of a nervous or chemical signal from an inflamed intestine. So no pathogen was present in these inflamed respiratory membranes. It was all coming from the intestine. I think that's very generally neglected in people treating respiratory sicknesses. They let them go on eating things that are known to favor bacterial growth in the small intestine.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. And if anybody's interested in an everyday phenomenon, notice when you eat something—a lot of times your nose will start to get moist on the inside. Maybe it's my age—I'm almost 65—but when I eat something now, it doesn't always happen, but I start to get a slightly runny nose.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, that was something I noticed about 60 some years ago when I worked in the woods. I would come in to eat supper in a restaurant, and I noticed day after day I would see someone eating pie a la mode or a milkshake, and by the time they got to the cash register, they would be sniffling.

**John Barkhousen:** Oh, just the thought of it. Was it just the thought of it that did that?

**Dr. Peat:** No, I think it was loosening up mucus, producing sort of a therapeutic cleansing reaction. When they got their blood sugar up, the first stage of inflammation increases circulation, but it can dry up the membranes and the mucus that they secrete becomes gummy and hardened and produces a dry cough.

But when you get your blood sugar up, the process can complete itself. It seems to need enough energy to produce a good flow of blood and mucus production so that it can wash away the histamine.

## Retroviruses, Stress, and Viral Expression
*retrovirus-expression, stress-genes, genetic-activation, jumping-genes*

**John Barkhousen:** Okay, I'm going to move on to another question. What about the theory that viruses are simply phages or somatids from bacteria, and viral infections are really caused by occult intracellular bacteria? Luke Montanjer, if I'm saying that right, insists that there must be an occult bacteria associated with HIV.

**Dr. Peat:** Those things do exist, but I don't think he was right in blaming it all on occult bacteria. We are loaded with potential viruses. Several percent of our genome, some people have identified as potential viruses or retroviruses. These are DNA that has been built into our system by exposure to the environment.

There's a lab in Germany that shows that you can identify beef DNA after you eat beef in the bloodstream, and then you can find it integrated into our genome. Whatever we eat that has DNA in it is likely to be able to enter cells and be integrated as a potential resource.

But when we're put under stress, Barbara McClintock was very unpopular for this in the 1940s and 50s when she talked about jumping genes. She showed that stress causes genes to come out of the chromosomes and move around to a different place.

Since we have these retroviruses, I think it's very, almost certain that under stress we will express retroviruses that have been in us for generations. If you look for them, they look like you have caught a viral infection from the outside. That's what Peter Duesberg has been saying for years now.

**John Barkhousen:** That's very interesting, but it's really just something coming out of you when you're getting disorganized.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, yeah. When people with tests for the HIV virus have looked at blood stored from army recruits in the 1960s and 70s, every year that the stored blood was tested showed roughly a 0.5% HIV infection rate. More recent tests have been in the same range as a general population.

If you look at sick people, you'll find a higher percentage. So it looks like an epidemic. You go to Africa where people are under stress and exposed to many infectious diseases, and you'll find a very high so-called infectious rate of HIV virus. But the standard healthy population historically has been one half percent.

If you stir up the organism and cause rearrangement of the genes as McClintock showed, stress induces the expression of what we can call viruses—retroviruses.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. I never understood what that meant before. I'm going to move right along here because here's a pertinent question. This says I heard that immunity after an infection with a coronavirus is quite short-lived. Unfortunately, I do not remember where he heard this. Does Mr. Peat have any opinion on acquired immunity to coronaviruses?

## Acquired Immunity and Fibrosis Risk
*immunity-duration, pulmonary-fibrosis, tissue-damage, inflammation*

**Dr. Peat:** No, not at all. But one thing that is known is that after a severe respiratory infection, there is a great increase in the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Just because inflammation leads to fibrosis and reduced lung function. So apart from any future risk, I think the real thing to worry about is to stop the progression of that angiotensin-related inflammatory production of tissue fibrosis and stiffness.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. And anti-inflammatories will do that, right?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, I see.

**John Barkhousen:** And what's the best way of delivering an anti-inflammatory to the lung?

## Treatment Recommendations and Prevention Strategy
*treatment-options, anti-inflammatory-delivery, prevention-measures*

**Dr. Peat:** I think through the mouth, just eating it. Losartan is currently being used. The Chinese are recommending a variety of things. They're including some virus-killing chemicals, but I think their main recommendations are Losartan and Cinanserin—the anti-serotonin things being very broad-spectrum protective and anti-inflammatory.

So I think ciproheptadine is a good, safe broad anti-inflammatory. A lot of people are recommending the old approach to viruses—the idea of killing the virus. In the '70s and '80s, antivirals based on the idea of nucleoside analogs to mutate the DNA of the virus—acyclovir and ribavirin, for example.

At that time, a lot of people were saying, if you mutate the DNA or RNA of a virus, aren't you likely to be mutating the human DNA? The FDA approved studies that said absolutely no—they're absolutely not going to mutate your gonadal DNA. But in recent years, 40 some years later, the studies are saying yes, definitely—they injure the gonads and mutate human DNA.

So people are now recommending widespread use protectively of nucleoside analog antivirals. But I think widespread use of that is going to create genetic damage to the reproducing population.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. And we're already seeing a lot of sterility amongst the general population. Well, we barely have any more time. So I apologize to everybody who sent in questions and we didn't get to them. Maybe, perhaps, Dr. Peat, you'll come back sometime and we could cover some of these. Perhaps at this point, with only a few minutes left to go, we should just sum up. What's the best course of action for people to protect themselves?

## Final Recommendations for Protection
*vitamin-d, aspirin-prophylaxis, immune-optimization, losartan, ciproheptadine*

**Dr. Peat:** My first recommendation was to eat well and make sure your vitamin D level is up to around 50-60 ng per ml on a blood test, which often takes 5,000 units a day. Use a very safe antiviral such as aspirin.

But if there's a sign of an infection, then I think Losartan and the anti-serotonin things would be appropriate to limit the degree of inflammation. Don't worry about killing the virus or becoming immune to some future variant, because your immune system is a lot better than the vaccines. But still, the immune system doesn't necessarily keep up with the mutating virus.

**John Barkhousen:** Okay. And Losartan and Ciproheptadine are good things to go to if aspirin isn't working, I think.

**Dr. Peat:** The Chinese recommend Cinanserin.

**John Barkhousen:** Oh, that's right.

**Dr. Peat:** I don't know. It might be better than ciproheptadine.

**John Barkhousen:** Okay. And you can also get vitamin D from sunlight, right? If you're someplace where it's sunny enough.

**Dr. Peat:** That's the best thing.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. All right, well, thanks for being on the air tonight, Ray. I really appreciate it, and I think everybody else does too. And if you don't mind sometime coming back, we'll get to these other questions.

**Dr. Peat:** Okay? Anytime.

**John Barkhousen:** Okay, that's wonderful. So maybe we'll do it next week if you're up for it.

**Dr. Peat:** Okay, great.

**John Barkhousen:** Well, thanks so much and I'm wishing you a good night and stay healthy.

**Dr. Peat:** Okay, thanks.

**John Barkhousen:** Okay, thanks, Ray.

**Dr. Peat:** Bye.

**John Barkhousen:** Bye. All right, thanks everybody for listening tonight. You heard Dr. Raymond Peat, and if you want more of his information, he has many articles on his website, which is raypeat.com. They're there, there's no charge. You can just go there and read a lot of good information and very interesting stuff too. So I hope you can avail yourself of that. I've been your host for Politics and Science, John Barkhousen. And it looks like next week we'll be back again with Dr. Raymond Peat to talk more about the coronavirus and get to some of the questions that we didn't get to tonight.

In fact, thanks to everybody who sent in questions. They were excellent. And we'll get to more of them next week at 5:00 clock Eastern Standard Time at wmrw.org. And now it's time to say, this is WMRW LP Warren and we're going to Letters in Politics with Mitch Jeseritz. Thanks for listening.
