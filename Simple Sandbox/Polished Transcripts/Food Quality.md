# Politics & Science: Food Quality

## Introduction
*industrial-food, food-quality, nutrition-standards*

**John Barkhousen:** Welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host John Barkhousen. This week I'm very pleased to have on my show Dr. Raymond Peat, who has a PhD in biology and has studied extensively in the fields of physiology and endocrinology. I consider him a very learned science historian. Ray, do you want to add anything to that bio or fix it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh no, that's okay.

**John Barkhousen:** This show is inspired by two letters Ray wrote on his website, raypeat.com. One is called "Milk in Allergy, Ecology and Some Myths" and the other is "Vegetables, etc. Who defines food?" Both take on the issue of the quality of our food and how it's evolved or devolved over the years.

Today I'd like to discuss various foods and how they've changed or been changed, and how our culture, food production processes, and our environment have influenced these changes. Many of us feel that if we eat the basic food groups, we'll get the nutrition we need to be healthy. But Ray, you write in these newsletters that good nutrition involves much more than essential nutrients.

So I'd like to back up a little bit and start at the beginning. How do we decide what is nutritious for us, and how are these decisions traditionally made as opposed to now?

## Traditional vs. Industrial Approaches to Nutrition
*nutrition-standards, food-industry, profit-motive, chemical-additives*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Traditionally, people just ate something that tasted good. If they survived and stayed healthy, their families and descendants kept eating it. Each area evolved pretty safe mixtures of foods. But as soon as organization got involved—pharaohs, kings, dukes, and eventually corporations—they decided people should eat what gave them the best profit. The health of the people varied according to the convenience of whoever was in charge of the economy.

Since World War II—well, the Germans really started it—when they were blockaded in the First World War, they had a good advanced chemical industry. They started learning how to make substitute foods and substitute materials for war and so on. By the Second World War, they had developed pretty good imitation foods. For example, they fed their Russian prisoners of war on sawdust bread that resembled bread but had no nutritional value.

The FDA saw the success of that and decided—even though in the 1940s they had said that gums weren't decent for human consumption and produced some kind of biological damage—they finally agreed with the corporations that it was okay to add fillers like sawdust, cellulose, seaweed gum, and various tree gums. Now a baker recently said that he hadn't realized he could make a good loaf of bread with 18% sawdust.

**John Barkhousen:** That's astounding. I remember when the fiber craze hit the general culture. There were breads in our supermarket here—I think maybe Arnold—but one of the brands definitely was advertising extra fiber, and in the ingredients was sawdust.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Now I think they have a more diplomatic way of saying that. I think they say "nutritional fiber."

**John Barkhousen:** When they say that, can that be sawdust?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Anytime there's a pleasant sounding, unfamiliar ingredient in food, it's probably a waste product from industry. The chitin and various waste products from the shrimp industry are now used in food as well as health foods. If you look at each industry and see what they had a problem getting rid of, then you'll see the food technologists learning how to make people eat it.

**John Barkhousen:** So the food waste just comes around again and gets recycled into the system.

## Industrial Waste Conversion to Food Products
*food-waste, environmental-regulation, fish-oil, orange-juice*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For example, the EPA was having complaints from insect infestation from the mountains of pulp waste from the orange juice industry. They told the industry to do something with their horrendous quantities of pulp. By using microbial enzymes, they found that they could make it water soluble and have creamy, pulpy, fibrous orange juice. But it happens to be a chemical that would never occur in natural fruit. It has very unpredictable health results in the intestine because it's something people would never have been exposed to naturally.

The fish industry had a similar interaction with the EPA. They were either dumping their fish processing waste into the ocean where they were processing, or hauling it inland for landfill. But it was so stinky the EPA told them to find other ways to dispose of it. That's where they came up with fish protein powders for sending to famine areas or using as a food additive in the US, plus fish oil. The fattened oil and protein are now used in health foods as well.

**John Barkhousen:** The solution to pollution is distribution, as I've heard. Well, that doesn't sound very appetizing. But I guess if you can sell it, this brings us to convincing people to eat things as food when they otherwise might not think it is. It's interesting that one culture will eat something that's completely abhorrent to another culture—like they do eat insects in Africa and consider them a delicacy, whereas in this country that's not considered normal or appetizing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Once when I was visiting friends in Mexico, I ate with them and there was a nice little thing that was sort of like a salmon cake patty, a mildly fishy tasting thing. I asked what it was and they said, we'll tell you after you finished.

**John Barkhousen:** Yikes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They said it was a mosquito cake. Mosquito larvae.

**John Barkhousen:** You're kidding!

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Mosquito larvae. That sounds like something skimmed off a pond.

**John Barkhousen:** And they can skim off enough larva to make a cake?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, they have very fine nets especially for them. They get some minnows, but that happened to be the very little mosquito wigglers.

**John Barkhousen:** And that's a traditional food of Mexico?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That particular area—it was over on the eastern side somewhere near Jalapa.

**John Barkhousen:** How did that sit in your stomach after you learned what it was?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, very well. It tasted just like eating a salmon patty.

**John Barkhousen:** Well, that's interesting. So how do we decide what food is? It sounds like you're saying that basically we're told what's food and what isn't, and our instincts aren't really working.

## Fungal-Infected Foods and Industrial Adaptation
*food-culture, corn, fungi, industrial-production*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it's the thought process. One of the ugliest Mexican food products, I think, is the fungus-infected corn kernel that makes a big blue swelling on the corn cob. It's a mushroom growing in the corn, but it stimulates a tumor in the corn. It's somewhere between a tumor and a fungus. But it makes a very pleasant, semi-mushroom-tasting material. You can buy them canned in the US.

**John Barkhousen:** That's something that isn't a traditional food, but has been adapted to for modern use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it is a traditional food. It's a very old source that just occurs spontaneously in the corn. But I guess they can infect corn to make it industrially.

**John Barkhousen:** Do you feel like most of the foods that we eat now are basically influenced by industrial marketing?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, almost entirely. About 40 or 50 years ago, I read that the food industry had been testing various things against their panel of experts. They found that the public taste preferred artificial flavors over real flavors in things like ice cream, after they had been so trained.

## Ice Cream: Labeling and Deception
*ice-cream, food-labeling, artificial-ingredients, deception*

**John Barkhousen:** It's hard to know where to go. This is such a huge topic. But since you mentioned ice cream, I know that at one time—maybe it's still true—they were actually exempt from revealing what their ingredients are. The ice cream lobby somehow obtained an exemption from the law by which people have to declare what's in foods. So they can say artificial flavors, and it's basically a bunch of chemicals.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's still the general practice. And worse than that, they don't even have to mention on the label something which is actually present if it was mostly removed. They call it a processing aid or incidental ingredient. Even though it's really there and they intended to remove the bulk of it, some is there and can cause allergic or toxic reactions, but they don't have to say it on the label.

**John Barkhousen:** So that's anything they want to use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anything, yeah. Even if everyone is following those extremely useless rules of the FDA, apparently the industry doesn't take the FDA very seriously. Because I've bought ice cream from companies that said "all natural ingredients," and I would generally intend to buy just vanilla because I didn't really trust them.

But sometimes I bought vanilla pure white ice cream from the company that used only natural ingredients, but it would have a very intense strawberry flavor. Other times from the same company, I bought what was labeled vanilla ice cream. It tasted just like vanilla ice cream, but it didn't have the black flecks that their vanilla normally did. Instead it was dark brown, chocolate colored, but absolutely vanilla tasting. From those two or three times that someone at the factory messed up, it proved that they use brown coloring and pink coloring and artificial flavoring instead of the three natural ingredients that they claim.

## Gums, Thickeners, and Allergic Reactions
*carrageenan, guar-gum, locust-bean-gum, allergies*

**John Barkhousen:** Might as well just cut to the chase here. One of the things I wanted to talk about is that ice cream makers use thickeners—the gums you were speaking of: carrageenan, locust bean gum, and guar gum. A lot of people out there think these might actually be good for you. But can you explain to people why these gums may actually be the thing causing allergic reactions, not the milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh well, the FDA recognized that problem 60 years ago. The literature is full of published reactions to all of those gums. Carrageenan and alginate from seaweed are probably the worst of them. Carrageenan is recognized to be carcinogenic to the intestine and liver and to produce inflammation. It's a standard lab method for producing arthritis or inflammation of any organ that they want to study.

But the assumption is that if it only irritates the intestine and causes cancer in the liver, that is tolerable. What they're neglecting is that these particles or fibers—even much bigger than the molecules that have the gum function—are fairly massively passed through the intestine. When a person is under stress, even bacteria and larger particles up to the size of a red blood cell or larger can go right from the intestine into the bloodstream. Then the immune system has direct interaction with them.

If the particle is big enough, it can stop the flow through a capillary or arteriole. So small additives aren't going to stay entirely in the intestine. The particles of silicon dioxide—people say "oh, that's just harmless sand-like material." But when it's produced by vaporization or precipitation, they might call it fumed silica or colloidal silica.

**John Barkhousen:** What's it used for?

## Silicon Dioxide and Fine Particulate Additives
*silicon-dioxide, additives, inflammation, scleroderma*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Almost everything. They can use it to create a viscous consistency in cosmetics, soaps, and any food that needs a new texture. Almost all vitamins and drugs are now using fat or something like it to make the powder flow nicely when they're running it through the machine. It's basically very finely powdered glass.

But the powder is much smaller than the particles of starch, for example, that can be preserved across into the bloodstream. At a certain size, they very easily go from the blood into tissue cells. At a certain size range, they are very able to cause sensitization. Something like silicosis—even though it's supposedly amorphous rather than crystalline, supposedly they aren't going to cause the silicosis-like reaction that people get from silicone implants and so on. But there is an actual immunological similarity and overlap when the particles are of a certain size.

There are various names for that, but silicon dioxide or silica is the basic description.

**John Barkhousen:** So that gets into your tissues and causes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Chronic inflammation and degenerative inflammatory changes. Such as lupus-like symptoms. Scleroderma is probably the most common thing caused by the silica reaction.

**John Barkhousen:** Now it's actually hard to buy any processed food that doesn't have some of these things: carrageenan, etc. I was very interested in your newsletter "Milk in Context, Allergies to Context and Some Myths" available on your website theraypeat.com. You were saying carrageenan causes a pseudo latex allergy reaction. Could you talk about that? A lot of people are allergic to latex.

## Carrageenan and Pseudo-Latex Allergy
*carrageenan, latex-allergy, bacteria, carcinogenic*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, one argument is that in its unbroken down form—fresh out of the seaweed—it doesn't cause cancer, even though it might cause horrible inflammation. But when you eat it, it passes through the intestine where bacteria break it down. The broken-down form of carrageenan is recognized as carcinogenic. But try to communicate the logic of that to any of the regulatory agencies, and they all just reveal that they're serving industry and convenience rather than protecting the public.

**John Barkhousen:** Well, that seems sort of odd because a lot of things are fairly harmless when they're outside your body, but when you eat them, they're poisonous. So I don't see why that would be hard for them to understand.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, they specifically say that undegraded fiber isn't carcinogenic, but degraded is carcinogenic. But they neglect to point out that your intestine has bacteria that can degrade it.

The reaction to latex is really a general phenomenon. Plants all have some kind of defense reaction. Even under the best conditions, they'll produce some of these. But they're able to adapt. When they're injured, they increase their defensive material. So if a bug bites a plant, it expresses the enzyme that can break down the fibrous material of the bug—the chitin. Chitinase is a general defensive enzyme intended to dissolve bugs and any pest that invades the plant.

But when you stress a plant in any way, it defends itself and increases all of these defensive toxic chemicals. Simply mistreating a plant by growing it in monoculture, forcing it with not-well-balanced fertilizers—the plant is intensely stressed. It produces increased amounts of these defensive toxins and enzymes. A plant growing in the wild might not be allergenic or toxic. But once you've cultivated it under extreme conditions for generations, it will produce things such as toxic latex that will kill people who are sensitized to it. Lots of stressed plants can produce exactly the same kind of enzyme. So it isn't just literal latex, but it's any stressed plant that is able to produce similar enzymes.

**John Barkhousen:** You're saying that people are allergic to latex because the plant is purposely producing a toxic chemical to protect itself when it's wounded? Latex comes from a rubber tree, right?

## Plant Stress and Cross-Reactive Allergens
*latex, bananas, rubber-trees, industrial-crops*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, bananas and rubber trees—they were the first ones to identify the same kind of allergic response and reaction between natural latex, rubber for example surgical gloves or other surgical materials, and bananas. People who have a dangerous reaction to one will usually have it to the other.

But those people will also react to any other kinds of fruit. I think kiwis are a major overlap, but probably almost any plant that is industrialized and forced into production will increase their production of these things. A person allergic to bananas is likely to be allergic to six, eight, or ten other similar fruits—not even similar fruits, but industrialized fruits.

**John Barkhousen:** And not all people are affected that way. Why? Maybe this is too big a question, but why are some people affected by those plant toxins and others not?

## Estrogen, Stress, and Immune Sensitivity
*estrogen, stress-response, intestinal-permeability, gluten*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The person who is under stress is the key. I think in that newsletter I mentioned that estrogen induces a similar protein in humans. Things like estrogen, which intensify the stress reaction, are probably increasing throughout, especially in industrialized populations. The biological function of estrogen is to stress and activate tissues to get them growing quickly. But it should only act for 12 or 24 hours per month to activate tissues, make them take up water, swell up, start growing, and so on.

But when we're chronically exposed to industrial estrogens in the environment, that activates our stress reactions in the intestine. It makes the intestine more permeable and will simply take up more things. But it also activates particular patterns of enzymes. It activates enzymes in the intestine that overlap with the gluten molecule.

Our immune systems, reacting to overdose of estrogen effect, don't distinguish that from gluten. The gluten interacts with chronic estrogen exposure to produce very serious chronic inflammatory symptoms. That enzyme happens to be a cross linker that estrogen activates in the skin, for example. It ties protein molecules together.

When this enzyme is extracted from microorganisms—bacteria make a similar enzyme—it can be used to tie any protein together that contains lysine and glutamic acid, which is basically any protein. The food industry is widely using that enzyme to make artificial fish and meat products.

**John Barkhousen:** Wait—are you saying there's an enzyme in processed meat products?

## Restructured Meat and Processed Products
*restructured-meat, processed-food, cross-linking-enzyme, waste-products*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If you go to a fast food restaurant and order a fish patty, you're probably getting a mixture of seaweed gum and fish waste fragments glued together with this enzyme, which cross-reacts with estrogen effects and gluten. You would never expect that sort of enzyme to exist in a fish patty, but it's industrially useful.

Lunch meats, even things that are sold as lamb chops, are imitated by gluing meat fragments together. They call it restructured meat. We accidentally had been eating squid patties for years. There was something in the meat case that looked like the usual product. I cooked two of them and they shrank down to about the size of a silver dollar from having been about 4 or 5 inches across.

We recognized something was wrong, but since that was what we fixed for supper, we went ahead and ate them and got really sick. I was sick for over a week after eating it. I looked up what was happening to squid patties.

They use seaweed jelly like alginate or carrageenan to make a jelly. Then they sweep up all of the waste products that didn't have the right shape and grind them into a mush. They add the cross-linking enzyme so that the mushroom coagulates. But it's intermixed with the seaweed jelly, so it contains a huge amount of water—much more water than normal squid. You get terrific shrinkage as well as this weird chemical composition: cross-linking fish proteins and squid proteins with seaweed jelly.

**John Barkhousen:** I don't think that would sell well on the menu at a restaurant.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, but you get it very often. Fast food places especially used to have textured soy protein that looks like chicken or ham. They were very skillful at making a fibrous meaty appearance in soybean protein. But now they don't even have to use that much of a natural product. It can be seaweed and waste meat scraps that are reshaped entirely.

**John Barkhousen:** You do wonder when you go by the deli in the supermarket and see all those hams, roast beefs, and other cold cuts. They're all so uniform and perfect—a turkey loaf. I suspect what you're talking about is how they achieve that uniform look.

## Processed Meat and Carcinogenic Additives
*processed-meat, preservatives, polyamines, cancer-risk*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And all the studies I've seen comparing various foods show that one of the most carcinogenic is processed meats—just as a big category. Anything processed, but that mostly includes those loafy materials.

**John Barkhousen:** Those meats are also full of a lot of additives, preservatives, and strange looking acronyms that represent chemicals. I suppose it's a combination of all that that is making them carcinogenic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and the aging process too. They add deodorants to change the smell of aged meat. But just the practice of aging meat probably makes it more carcinogenic because when meat starts to rot, the odor chemicals are polyamines. Cadaverine and putrescine are the chemical names of two of the things that aging produces. Those stimulate cell growth.

There are techniques being developed to block the production of those in tissues to stop cancer growth. So their connection with cancer is well known. Just storage of the meat too long will produce those things. And then on top of that, they add the various preservatives and even the harmless-sounding things like citric acid, because they're produced by microorganisms from waste byproducts. You get some of the chemicals from the industrial waste material that you started with and then some microbial additions to the mix.

No matter how careful they are trying to refine out a pure citric acid, it always has traces of where it came from. So even the nice-sounding ingredients aren't really so nice when you might be sensitized to them.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, that sounds rather discouraging. But I did want to ask you about aging meats. A lot of people around here raise their own cattle and sheep. It's common knowledge that it doesn't taste good unless you age it, hang it for a few days—maybe five days at 40 degrees. The meat gets more tender and gets more flavor.

## Meat Aging and Toxin Production
*meat-aging, freshness, taste, toxins*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It definitely gets more flavor, but that's mostly advertising. The people who are in the habit of doing it that way insist it tastes better. But the reason I eat more meat when I'm in Mexico is that it tastes better because it's fresh. They don't—in the small towns where they don't have refrigerators, they just sell it off the carcass. They have to sell it within the first two, three, or four days. It always tastes really fresh.

It's very rare to find fresh-tasting meat in the US.

**John Barkhousen:** Up here, the people I know hang it for maybe four days at a very cold temperature, like 40 degrees, which would be difficult to do in Mexico, I imagine.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but four or five days at 40 degrees, it still can taste very fresh. But in the supermarket, the food technology people have said that it gets tender after two weeks. So you shouldn't sell it before two weeks. But it also develops putrescine, spermidine, and cadaverine that are mildly toxic, possibly carcinogenic.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, I gotta say, putrescine doesn't sound too good to me.

## FDA Enforcement and Animal Treatment
*FDA, animal-welfare, chemical-treatment, steroids*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the FDA has never been very enthusiastic—nor the Agriculture Department—about enforcing the laws against chemical treatment of the animals while they're alive. There is some pressure to make them not inject chemicals in the last day or so before they kill the animal. But in Europe recently, there has been evidence that they're treating their living animals with big doses of glucocorticoid steroids to break down the fiber while they're alive, to tenderize the meat.

**John Barkhousen:** Now, I thought Europe was averse to that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, they are. But they, I guess, aren't spending enough enforcement money. The industry is getting away with breaking the rules.

**John Barkhousen:** You were going to say something else when I interrupted there.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, just that even though the rules are in place, you can't trust anything that comes from a big corporation because the FDA is doing its best to look the other way.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, I think that's something we've discussed before on various shows. It does seem that the regulatory agencies are really there to just absorb the liability of the corporation and be a buffer between them and the public.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think so.

## Growing Practices and Plant Physiology
*monoculture, fertilization, plant-stress, nutrient-imbalance*

**John Barkhousen:** We haven't discussed in detail growing practices. You said that growing crops in monoculture makes plants produce a lot more toxic chemicals. Is there a way of growing things that isn't so stressful?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If the plant grows more slowly, the soil will more naturally release chemicals that the plant can select from. But when they're adding chemicals that they know will stimulate the fastest maturation and production—whatever they're interested in—the plant isn't absorbing exactly the ideal combination of nutrients. It distorts the actual structure and physiology of the plant.

There have been experiments in which corn was fertilized heavily with potassium in one case and with phosphate in the other group. I forget which way it went. I think potassium fertilizer caused the plants to emphasize their tassels—the male pollen-producing component. And I think phosphate fertilizer made them overproduce the female cob, part of the reproductive material. You can almost change the sex ratio, the balance between the male and female parts of the plant, just by pushing one or the other kind of fertilizer.

Just for those two ingredients alone, the plant isn't going to be as happy being forced in that direction. Since its physiology is warped, that's usually enough work to also produce some of the toxic chemicals defensively. One of the things that people have known for many years is that the roots of plants generally have less of the defensive toxic chemicals that affect animals because they're defending against fungus and bacteria that live in the ground.

The upper part of the plant—the leaves, stems, and seeds—are defending against grazing animals, insects, and people that pluck off the easiest parts to get at. So the worst toxins are in the leaves and seeds. In many cases, the plants want to spread their seeds by having birds or other animals eat the fruit and pass the seeds through to propagate them elsewhere. The fruits are evolved in many cases to be delicious, nutritious, and non-toxic. If you look at the plant's defense system, the fruits are almost always the safest part. The roots would come in next as the second safest. Seeds are the very worst for the plant's toxins. Leaves are intermediate for toxicity.

**John Barkhousen:** Is that in part why so many people have an intolerance of gluten and flour products?

## Gluten, Storage Proteins, and Plant Defense
*gluten, storage-proteins, flour, plant-toxins*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, all of the storage proteins have multiple functions. Not only do they pack a lot of nitrogen into a small space in the seeds so that when water is available, enzymes can rearrange the stored energy material with the nitrogen and double or triple the amount of protein—basically just packing nitrogen into specialized protein for storage. But those proteins also have the added benefit to the plant of being irritating, indigestible, or toxic to lots of predators.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. Somebody pointed out recently, I think on a show with you, that the gluten that everybody seems to be allergic to these days is considerably worse than it used to be. They've been actually breeding wheat plants to develop more gluten because it's useful industrially for producing food products. That's made it easier for them to produce bread, but harder for people to digest it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

**John Barkhousen:** That sort of brings up the subject of agricultural practice and breeding, and its new form of genetic engineering. A lot of food products are being bred not for delightful eating, but for marketing—meaning that they ship well and store well, but they don't necessarily taste well.

## Industrial Crop Breeding and Genetic Engineering
*genetic-engineering, crop-breeding, heirloom-varieties, allergies*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, in the 1940s, tomatoes often had a very intense, nice aromatic flavor. I haven't seen a tomato like that for about 50 years because all the commercial seeds—even people who buy seeds at a seed store are going to get non-traditional fruits. Every farmer used to have their own variety of vegetables. Those heirloom vegetables have largely been lost. Some people are storing the seeds, but they aren't being widely propagated around here.

**John Barkhousen:** People are always buying them. They are available—the heirloom tomatoes. We've been plagued by blight these last few years, so I don't think many people have gotten great ones. What's your take on the effect of genetic engineering on food quality? Is there any benefit? We're mostly talking about the harmful effects of industrial practices on food. But perhaps there's a silver lining somewhere.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, the genetic engineering—the most common thing is to put an insecticide protein into the plant. People or animals are known to react allergically to a strange protein that wasn't there before. And other insects—they're seeing butterflies killed by the insecticides that were put there to defend the plant or make it more profitable to produce. Yeah, I think allergy is the main thing to worry about with meddling with genetic composition of plants.

**John Barkhousen:** Well, the allergies certainly seem to be on the rise from my observations. What's your take on people's allergies?

## Omega-3 Fats and Prenatal Sensitization
*omega-3-fats, pregnancy, allergies, fish-oil*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think all of the major allergic symptoms are increasing. But some studies show that unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids in a woman's diet when she's pregnant seriously increase the allergies of the baby. So it isn't just that the food supply is changing, but the human supply is being sensitized by the stressful things in our national diet.

**John Barkhousen:** And can you explain what that is, Ray?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, the omega-3 fats are—grass, for example, has more than the grain seed product. The seeds have more of the omega-6 fats and they're a little more stable. The omega-3, I think, are in the leaves because they don't have to be stable for so long. The cold temperature resistance corresponds to the highly unsaturated, especially omega-3 fats.

So algae in the ocean at a low temperature will produce highly unsaturated omega-3 fats that are known as fish oils. When the fish elongate them, they're being highly promoted—starting, I guess, with the waste from the fish industry. The discovery that linoleic acid, which was popularized as the essential fatty acid, was pretty carcinogenic led to a shift in marketing from cottonseed oil or safflower oil type of fat over to the fish oil type. All kinds of arguments have been advanced to encourage people to eat more of those.

A French group decided that since the brain of an adult contains lots of fish oil-like fats—on the diets that we've been exposed to—babies, any mammal before it's born, synthesizes mostly saturated fats out of the glucose and fructose absorbed from the mother's blood. This French group said the baby's brains aren't getting enough fish oil. They set up an apparatus to make a sound and record the fetus's response to the sound. So they could tell how alert the fetus's nervous system was. They were going to demonstrate that they could make the fetus learn faster by feeding the mother fish oil.

What they found was that the nervous function was impaired in the women who ate the fish oil. Other studies showed that the babies would be more allergic too. In the study of the learning ability, they also found that the babies were smaller, implying that their brains and bodies altogether grew less under the influence of the fish oil. Probably because of the anti-progesterone effect, keeping the bias in the uterus towards estrogen against progesterone—progesterone being the brain growth factor—and lowering thyroid in proportion to the unsaturation of the fats.

So the population which has its progesterone and thyroid suppressed is going to be the more allergic, stressed population.

**John Barkhousen:** And you're saying the fish oil is also included in the same category as vegetable oils like safflower oil and cottonseed oil?

## Comparing Fish Oils and Seed Oils
*fish-oil, seed-oils, omega-6, omega-3, oxidation*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A big difference is that the seed oils are highly unsaturated, but they're omega-6, which means that they have a tail of 5 carbon atoms that are saturated. Stearic acid and palmitic acid are things that we can synthesize in our bodies out of sugar, and those are all saturated and very stable. But at least the seed oils have this chain of 5 completely saturated carbons at the tail end.

The fish oils, omega-3, have only two stable carbons at the end, so they oxidize much more easily.

**John Barkhousen:** I get you. So in the few minutes we have left, Ray, perhaps we should try to strike some kind of a positive note. There is food out there to eat. In your opinion, what food should people be focusing on both for pleasure and for health?

## Food Recommendations for Health
*food-choices, fruits, eggs, meat, dairy*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, fruits—if you know that they're grown in a safe, unchemically treated environment. It's fairly hard to find really ripe fruit in the stores. But if you can find ripe oranges or tangerines, those are very safe. Juicing, for example.

And eggs, if you can find eggs that weren't fed linseed oil or soy oil or something that gives them a fishy taste. Just go by the taste. Sweet oranges. Eggs that taste like eggs and not like fish meal. And meats that taste fresh. Milk—it's important to judge the taste of the milk too, because there are so many different feeds that the cows get. If they feed a natural pasture that's full of allergenic weeds, organic milk can be allergenic, just because the cow is eating a weird mixture of vegetables.

Those foods are really the only ones I trust at all, and I'm suspicious of them. In American stores: eggs, milk, some cheeses. You have to be very cautious with cheeses because they're putting seaweed and other gums in them to increase their water content. Eggs and meat are among the safest.

**John Barkhousen:** Just to go back to the dark side, they're increasing the water content for what reason? To get more money for the cheese? To add to the weight?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah, they can add 30% to the weight just by putting more jelly in it. There was a Wisconsin Parmesan that I ate for years. Suddenly it got soft and moist and caused bowel inflammation in me. So I stopped that and found the real Parmesan—called Radiano—is the only one. That and a couple of other strange ethnic cheeses from Greece or Italy still have the traditional methods.

**John Barkhousen:** You've said that fresh cheeses are safer to eat than aged cheeses. But it sounds like you're eating some aged cheeses.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, because I can't find any fresh cheeses in the US that don't have added age.

**John Barkhousen:** What's the difference between fresh and aged? In terms of benefit, what's the difference?

## Fresh vs. Aged Cheese
*cheese, aging, fermentation, safety*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They should be chemically and nutritionally very similar in value. But the aging process typically involves the growth of a fungus that improves the taste by giving them aromatic qualities. But it is also a risk if they use a different fungus than one you're accustomed to. So for security, cottage cheese, if they haven't added anything, is very safe. But I don't use any cottage cheese now without washing it, because the ones that I have access to add lactic acid and what they call dressing. By rinsing it, I lose about 30% of the weight of the material, but it comes out to be a clean, clean milk curd.

**John Barkhousen:** So milk, eggs, and some meats—if you can find some that are raised without pesticides.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And fruits. Some of the very specialty things that you only see once or twice a year, even in very adventurous stores: chirimoyas and sapotas. I think California and Florida grow some good sapotes. Some of those very sweet, mushy pawpaws are available in parts of the south especially. Occasionally they come out to the coast. But the southern states, they're a traditional fall fruit.

**John Barkhousen:** I've never had any of them. They all sound very exotic.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, they were like—George Washington, I think, said the pawpaw is his favorite dessert.

**John Barkhousen:** Is that right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're very common native dessert, but because of industrialization, they're tender and fragile and so they aren't good fruit of commerce.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, it's like a real peach, which I actually had one of those fairly recently. It was unbelievable when you get a real peach. Hey, you know, one dairy product that we found recently that we think is pretty good—it's called Faya. It's a Greek strained yogurt.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It seems that they've got most of the lactic acid out of it.

**John Barkhousen:** It has no extra ingredients listed on it. So it just seems to be milk, maybe some salt.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The main thing wrong with ordinary yogurt is that it's got lots of lactic acid in it. It's basically the same as cottage cheese for safety. I think it's good.

**John Barkhousen:** So if you can strain the lactic acid—we've covered this in other shows—you don't think it's a good idea to eat extra lactic acid. Then it's a good food.

## Lactic Acid and Health Implications
*lactic-acid, exercise, cancer, inflammation*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it should be minimized. That's why I don't advocate aerobic exercise. People should do everything they can to minimize lactic acid. I think I'm going to do a newsletter on cancer and the role of lactic acid in cancerization. But it also promotes inflammation and fibrosis and degenerative diseases. So it's good to avoid it in foods as well as produced by stress.

**John Barkhousen:** Well, I look forward to that newsletter, Ray. Now we are actually out of time. I should tell everybody that Dr. Raymond Peat has a PhD in biology and extensive studies in the fields of physiology, biology, and endocrinology. He knows a lot about science history. You can visit his website at raypeat.com—that's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com—where you'll find the articles we were discussing today and many, many others. Ray, thanks so much for coming on Politics and Science.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.
