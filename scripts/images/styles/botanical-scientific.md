## Prompt Language

```
STYLE: Scientific botanical illustration. Precise ink linework with delicate stippling
for shading. The observational detail of a naturalist's field drawing. Clean white background.
Specimen presented with clarity and reverence. Think vintage encyclopedia plate or
Ernst Haeckel's scientific illustrations.

TEXTURE: Fine pen strokes, stippled shading, optional soft watercolor wash for color.
Paper has subtle tooth. Lines are confident but delicate.

AVOID: Heavy outlines, cartoon simplification, busy backgrounds, digital smoothness.
