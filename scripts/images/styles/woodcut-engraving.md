## Prompt Language

```
STYLE: Traditional woodcut engraving illustration. Bold black lines on cream paper.
Shading achieved through careful hatching and cross-hatching. High contrast.
Hand-carved quality with visible tool marks. Dense, intricate linework in the focal subject,
minimal background. Think Albrecht Dürer meets vintage book illustration.

TEXTURE: Slightly textured cream paper. Ink has weight and presence.
Lines vary from thick outlines to fine hatching detail.

AVOID: Smooth gradients, photorealistic shading, digital smoothness, color fills.
