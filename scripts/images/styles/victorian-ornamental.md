## Prompt Language

```
STYLE: Victorian ornamental engraving. Fine detailed linework with decorative borders
and flourishes. The elegance of a vintage stock certificate or book frontispiece.
Symmetrical composition with clear hierarchy. Dense ornamentation that frames
rather than overwhelms the central subject. Think 19th century commercial printing
at its most refined.

TEXTURE: Engraved line quality - precise, controlled, varying line weight for depth.
Aged paper tone. Ink has presence and permanence.

AVOID: Modern minimalism, sparse compositions, digital flatness, casual linework.
