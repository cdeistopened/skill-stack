# Skill Stack Thumbnail Style

A clean, minimal editorial style inspired by the Skill Stack logo - stacked document shapes with terracotta accent on warm cream background.

## Brand Identity

**Logo concept**: Stacked paper documents (3 gray layers + 1 terracotta top layer with folded corner)

**Vibe**: Anthropic-adjacent sophistication. Publishing meets productivity. Knowledge accumulation visualized.

## Color Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Terracotta/Coral | `#D4654A` | Primary accent - use on ONE key element |
| Warm Cream | `#F5F3EE` | Background |
| Light Gray | `#E8E6E1` | Paper layer 1 |
| Medium Gray | `#DEDBD5` | Paper layer 2 |
| Darker Gray | `#D4D1CB` | Paper layer 3 |
| Near-Black | `#2D2D2D` | Text, linework (sparingly) |

## Visual Approach

**Core metaphor**: Stacked/layered elements representing accumulated knowledge and skills

**Key characteristics**:
- Flat paper shapes with subtle drop shadows
- Clean geometric forms
- Single focal concept per image
- Generous negative space (40%+ of frame)
- Asymmetrical composition
- Maximum 2-3 distinct elements

## Composition Rules

1. **Focal point offset** - Never dead center. Use rule of thirds.
2. **Breathing room** - Leave space for the eye to rest
3. **Layer depth** - Use subtle shadows to create depth without 3D rendering
4. **Text-safe zone** - Keep left third or bottom quarter clear for potential text overlay

## What Works

- Document/paper metaphors (stacked, fanned, folded)
- Simple geometric shapes
- Single objects with meaning
- Conceptual juxtaposition (2 elements that create meaning together)
- Hand-drawn quality linework (when appropriate)

## What to Avoid

- Glossy/hyper-rendered AI aesthetic
- Photorealistic rendering
- More than 3 distinct elements
- Cliche imagery (lightbulbs, handshakes, arrows)
- Busy compositions
- Neon or saturated colors
- Stock photo vibes
- Gradients (keep it flat)
