## The "Start Questioning" Method - Deep Dive

### How It Works

Ask who/what/where/when/why/how about your topic. Then dig deeper by asking multiple times on the same answer.

**The key:** Don't stop at the first answer. The first answer is usually obvious. The gold is 2-3 levels deeper.

---

### Extended Example 1: Productized Services

**Topic:** Productized services for freelancers

**Round 1: Surface Questions**
- **What?** "What are productized services?" → Fixed-scope packages at set prices
- **Who?** "Who creates them?" → Freelancers, consultants, agencies
- **Where?** "Where do they sell?" → Websites, marketplaces, referrals
- **When?** "When did they become popular?" → Growing rapidly last 5 years
- **Why?** "Why do freelancers choose them?" → Predictable income, easier sales, less scope creep
- **How?** "How do they work?" → Package expertise into repeatable deliverables

**Round 2: Dig Deeper on Promising Angles**

Chose "Why do freelancers choose them?" to explore deeper:

- **Why does predictable income matter?** → Easier to plan and grow
- **Why does that matter?** → Less stress, more focus on quality
- **Why is that important?** → Freelancers who actually ENJOY their work vs constantly chasing clients
- **What's the transformation?** → From anxious hustler to confident business owner

Chose "How do they start?" to explore deeper:

- **How do they start?** → Pick one thing you do repeatedly, package it
- **What do you need?** → Not much - no special tools required
- **Why is that significant?** → Removes the "I'm not ready" barrier
- **What's the insight?** → **"You don't need a fancy funnel to start a productized service"**

**Impact angle discovered:** "You don't need a fancy funnel to start a productized service"

This became the hook angle because it challenges assumption (you need complex systems to sell services) and empowers action (anyone can do this).

### Extended Example 2: Corporate Exec Gone Solopreneur

**Topic:** Fortune 500 executive who left to build a one-person business

**Round 1: Surface Questions**
- **What?** "What's the story?" → Executive left to go solo
- **Who?** "Who is she?" → 20+ year corporate leader, knows big business inside-out
- **Why?** "Why did she leave?" → Saw system limitations firsthand
- **How?** "How did it turn out?" → Earns more working less, fully independent
- **What's surprising?** → Person who RAN corporate teams chose NOT to build another one

**Round 2: Dig Deeper**

Chose "Why solo specifically?" to explore:

- **Why not just start another company with a team?** → Wanted to stay in control and keep it simple
- **Why does that matter?** → Less overhead, more creative freedom
- **What's the belief?** → Leverage matters more than headcount
- **What's the proof?** → Out-earns old salary, works 25 hours/week, no employees

Chose "What's surprising about this?" to explore:

- **Why is an insider choosing not to build a team?** → She saw what big teams can't provide
- **What can't they provide?** → True flexibility, creative control, work-life integration
- **What's the transformation for readers?** → From "you need a team to scale" to "leverage beats headcount"

**Angles discovered:**
1. "The Fortune 500 VP who chose to stay solo"
2. "Leverage matters more than headcount"
3. "How a corporate insider built a one-person million-dollar business"

### Extended Example 3: Mastery Learning Trap

**Topic:** Mastery-based learning and its potential downsides

**Round 1: Surface Questions**
- **What?** "What is mastery learning?" → Must master topic before moving forward
- **Why?** "Why do educators like it?" → No gaps in knowledge
- **What's the problem?** → Can be too rigid, creates bottlenecks
- **Who does this affect?** → Students who learn differently or at different paces

**Round 2: Dig Deeper**

Chose "What's the actual problem?" to explore:

- **What happens when kid gets stuck?** → Can't move forward until mastery
- **Why is that a problem?** → Might master it LATER, but blocked NOW
- **What's the cost?** → Lose momentum, motivation drops
- **What's the insight?** → Sometimes moving forward maintains motivation better than perfection

Chose "What's the alternative?" to explore:

- **What would work better?** → Strategic incompleteness - know enough to progress
- **Why does that work?** → Maintains momentum, can circle back later
- **What's the metaphor?** → Like video games - you don't 100% every level before advancing
- **What's the transformation?** → From "must master everything" to "progress matters more than perfection"

**Impact angle discovered:** "The Mastery Trap: Why knowing 80% might be better than 100%"

## Identifying the Transformation Framework

### Story = Problem + Goal + Path

Every compelling hook promises movement along this path.

**Headline options based on transformation:**
- "The Fortune 500 VP who chose to stay solo (and why she out-earns her old salary)"

## "Become the Reader" Check - Detailed

### The 3 Critical Questions

**1. "What's in it for me?"**

Test: Read your hook and immediately answer: "So what?" from reader's perspective.

❌ **Too vague:** "Learn about productized services"
→ So what? Why does this matter to me?

✅ **Clear benefit:** "Discover why top freelancers switched to productized services (and if it might fit your business)"
→ Aha! This tells me if I should consider this option.

**2. "Is this too abstract?"**

Test: Can you picture what this promises? If not, neither can your reader.

❌ **Too abstract:** "Optimize your client acquisition strategy"
→ What does that even look like?

✅ **Concrete:** "How one freelancer cut sales calls from 10/week to 2 (while doubling revenue)"
→ I can picture this exact scenario and transformation.

**3. "Would I stop scrolling?"**

Test: Honest gut check - in a feed of 100 posts, does this make you pause?

❌ **Boring:** "Important information about pricing strategies"
→ Would scroll past without noticing.

✅ **Scroll-stopping:** "The Fortune 500 VP who left to run a one-person business (and out-earns her old salary)"
→ Wait, what? That's surprising. I'd click.

### Example Check: Productized Services Headline

**Draft headline:** "Productized services are growing in popularity"

→ Fails. No clear benefit or relevance to reader.

**Too abstract check:**
❌ What does "growing in popularity" mean? What does that change for me?

❌ Boring. Generic trend statement.
→ Fails.

**Revised headline:** "Productized services now power 40% of top agencies. Here's why that number matters for your freelance business."

**"What's in it for me?" check:**
✅ Scale validation might mean this is viable option for me.
→ Passes.

**Too abstract check:**

→ Passes.

**Would I stop scrolling check:**
✅ Surprising stat, unexpected comparison, relevance promised.
→ Passes.

## Common Ideation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Stopping at Surface Level

❌ **Example:**
- Question: "What are productized services?"
- Answer: "Fixed-price packages"
- Hook: "Learn about fixed-price packages"
→ Boring. No depth.

✅ **Better:**
- Question: "What are productized services?"
- Answer: "Fixed-price packages"
- **Dig deeper:** "Why do freelancers choose them?"
- **Dig deeper:** "What makes them different from retainers?"
- **Dig deeper:** "What do clients get that they wouldn't elsewhere?"
- Answer: "Predictability + defined scope combo"
- Hook: "The one thing productized services offer that hourly billing and retainers both miss"
→ Interesting. Specific insight.

### Mistake 2: Generic Transformation

❌ **Generic:**
- Problem: Business isn't working
- Goal: Better business
- Path: Try alternatives

✅ **Specific:**
- Problem: Freelancers hate chasing clients and feel trapped in feast-or-famine cycles
- Goal: Predictable income and feeling in control of the business
- Path: Discover productized services as accessible scalable alternative

### Mistake 3: No Clear "What's In It For Me"

❌ **Unclear benefit:**
"The story of how one freelancer switched to productized services"
→ Interesting story, but what do I get from reading?

✅ **Clear benefit:**
"What one freelancer learned from 3 years of productized services (and 3 mistakes they'd avoid)"
→ I'll learn lessons and avoid mistakes.
