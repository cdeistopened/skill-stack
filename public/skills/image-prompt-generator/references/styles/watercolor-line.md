# Watercolor + Line Art

Loose ink linework with watercolor washes. Warmer and more approachable than pure ink, but still editorial and hand-crafted. Good for emotional or narrative content.

## When to Use

- Stories with emotional resonance
- Content about growth, journey, transformation
- When you want warmth without being saccharine
- Seasonal or nature-related topics
- When pure black and white feels too stark

## Visual Approach

The line art provides structure and clarity. The watercolor adds warmth, mood, and depth. Neither dominates - they work together.

**Key characteristics:**
- Confident ink linework as the skeleton
- Watercolor washes that bleed slightly beyond the lines
- Colors pooling naturally, not perfectly contained
- Hand-painted feel - visible brushstrokes in the wash
- Imperfect edges where water met paper

## Color Application

Use a limited, intentional palette. Example colors:
- **Warm accent** (burnt orange, terracotta) for emphasis
- **Cool accent** (sky blue, teal) for contrast or backgrounds
- **Near-black** ink for all linework
- **Warm off-white** paper showing through
- **Light gray** wash for subtle shadows

Colors should feel like they came from a limited watercolor palette - not every hue available, just a few used with intention. Adjust based on your brand identity.

## Technical Direction

```
STYLE: Hand-drawn ink linework with loose watercolor washes. The lines are confident and slightly sketchy - not precious. Watercolor bleeds slightly beyond the linework, pooling naturally. Think illustrated children's book for adults, or editorial travel illustration.

RENDERING: Ink lines first, then watercolor laid over and around them. Colors should pool and blend where they meet. Leave some white paper showing through. Brushstrokes visible in the wash areas.

TEXTURE: Paper grain affecting how watercolor settles. Slight bleeding at edges. The "happy accidents" of real watercolor - blooms, pooling, uneven saturation.
```

## Example Prompt Structure

```
Create a watercolor and ink illustration of [SUBJECT].

CONCEPT: [What are we looking at and what mood should it convey?]

STYLE: Hand-drawn ink linework with loose watercolor washes. Confident, slightly sketchy lines provide structure. Watercolor bleeds naturally beyond the lines - not perfectly contained. Think editorial travel illustration or illustrated essay.

COMPOSITION: [Describe arrangement, focal point, balance]

COLORS: Limited palette - burnt orange and sky blue washes over near-black ink linework on warm off-white paper. Colors should pool and blend naturally. Leave some white paper breathing through.

TEXTURE: Visible brushstrokes in watercolor areas. Paper grain showing. Natural watercolor effects - slight bleeding, pooling, uneven saturation.

AVOID: Digitally perfect edges, gradients, photorealistic rendering, too many colors, overly saturated tones, busy compositions.

FORMAT: [16:9 / 1:1 / 9:16]
