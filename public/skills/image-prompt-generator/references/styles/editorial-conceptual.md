# Editorial Conceptual Style

A sophisticated visual style for content that needs to appear thoughtful and editorial. Conceptual, witty, and distinctly non-generic.

## Visual Approach

Think Every.to, The Economist covers, or smart magazine design - not illustration-heavy, not busy. Images should make the viewer pause and think.

**Two complementary directions:**

1. **Conceptual Editorial** - Visual wit with maximum 2-3 elements, unexpected juxtaposition, metaphor over literal. A compass needle pointing at a question mark. A key made of building blocks. A door opening into graph paper sky.

2. **Ink + Watercolor Illustration** - Hand-drawn editorial illustration style. New Yorker meets thoughtful zine. Confident linework with intentional imperfection. Crosshatching for depth. Characters as thoughtful sketches, not rendered 3D figures.

## Color Palette (Customizable)

Default palette - adjust based on brand identity:

- **Primary Accent** - Use sparingly for emphasis (e.g., burnt orange, bold blue)
- **Secondary Accent** - Supporting color
- **Near-Black** - Linework and forms
- **Warm Off-White** - Background
- **Light Gray** - Subtle tones, borders

Avoid: Rainbow palettes, neon colors, overly saturated combinations.

## Texture and Materiality

- Graph paper as artistic element - not wallpaper, but integrated (emerging from an object, forming part of the composition, used as sky or ground)
- Hand-drawn quality in linework - confident but not precious
- Analog textures: pencil marks, eraser smudges, notebook edges, torn paper
- The "made by hand" feeling should be subtle, not crafty

## Composition

- Clean, uncluttered - if it feels busy, remove something
- Strong focal hierarchy - one thing dominates, other elements support
- Asymmetrical balance
- Room to breathe
- Leave text-safe zones on left or bottom third if needed for overlay

## Expressions (When Including Figures)

- Curious, contemplative, determined, or quietly confident
- No forced smiles or generic enthusiasm
- Figures should feel like thoughtful sketches, not stock photography

## Avoids (Enforce Strictly)

- Glossy, hyper-rendered AI aesthetic
- Generic stock photo scenes
- Clipart style or corporate illustration
- Soft gradients or airbrushed effects
- Emojis or cartoonish faces
- Cliche imagery (lightbulbs for ideas, handshakes for partnership)
- More than 3 distinct elements
- Busy compositions or quadrant layouts
- Decorative complexity

## Example Prompt Structure

```
Create a conceptual editorial image about [TOPIC].

CONCEPT: [One-sentence visual metaphor - what unexpected juxtaposition represents this idea?]

STYLE: Hand-drawn editorial illustration with confident ink linework. Intentional imperfection - not polished or corporate. Subtle watercolor wash for depth. Think New Yorker meets thoughtful zine.

COMPOSITION: Asymmetrical, with [focal element] as the dominant element. Generous negative space. [Secondary element] should feel organic, not wallpapering the background.

COLOR PALETTE (adjust for brand):
- Linework in near-black
- Background warm off-white
- One primary accent on [specific element]
- Subtle gray tones for depth

TEXTURE: Analog quality - visible ink texture, slight paper grain. Graph paper emerging from [location]. The hand-made feeling should be evident but not overdone.

AVOID: Glossy rendering, soft gradients, generic stock imagery, cliche symbols, busy composition, more than 2-3 distinct elements.

FORMAT: [16:9 / 1:1 / 9:16]
