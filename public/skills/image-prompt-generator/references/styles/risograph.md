# Risograph / Screen Print Style

**Default style for Skill Stack thumbnails.**

## Aesthetic

Risograph printing aesthetic - the handmade quality of indie printmaking. Warm, tactile, analog. Think limited-edition art prints from an indie press, zine culture, album art, indie publishing.

## Key Characteristics

- **Halftone dots**: Visible dot patterns, not smooth gradients
- **Misregistration**: Slight offset between color layers (the "imperfect" look)
- **Limited palette**: 2-4 spot colors, not full CMYK
- **Paper texture**: Cream/off-white paper stock shows through
- **Overprint**: Colors overlap and mix where layers meet
- **Flat color**: Bold, unmodulated color areas

## Color Palette (Skill Stack)

| Color | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| Cream paper | Background - visible paper texture |
| Terracotta/coral (#D4654A) | Hero accent - use on ONE key element |
| Medium grays | Supporting shapes, shadows |
| Optional: muted blue, yellow | Secondary accents when needed |

## Prompt Template

```
STYLE: Risograph / screen print aesthetic. Limited color palette with
visible halftone dots and slight misregistration between color layers.
The handmade quality of indie printmaking - warm, tactile, analog.

This should feel like a limited-edition art print from an indie press.
Contemporary but not digital-slick. References zine culture,
album art, indie publishing aesthetic.

COLOR: Cream paper background. [Describe subject colors].
Terracotta/burnt coral as the hero accent - saturated, prominent.

TEXTURE: Visible halftone dots. Slight color misregistration between layers.
Paper grain shows through. NOT smooth digital gradients.

AVOID: Digital smoothness, photorealism, glossy AI aesthetic, busy compositions.
```

## Example Concepts

**Voice Matching**: Two overlapping paper silhouettes - one gray, one terracotta - where the second echoes the first. Misregistration creates depth.

**4S Framework**: Four ascending shapes (like a prism dispersing light), bottom three in graduating grays, top one bold terracotta. Halftone shading on the prism.

**Anti-AI Writing**: Crumpled paper (halftone texture) transforming into a crisp document. The "before" in mixed chaotic colors, the "after" clean with terracotta accent.

## When to Use Other Styles

- **minimalist-ink.md**: For craft/mastery posts, Durer-inspired precision
- **watercolor-line.md**: For warmer, more organic topics
- **editorial-conceptual.md**: For abstract/philosophical posts

Default to risograph unless the content calls for something different.
