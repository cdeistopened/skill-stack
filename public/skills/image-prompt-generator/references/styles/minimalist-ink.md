# Minimalist Ink Illustration

High-contrast black and white illustrations with a hand-drawn, editorial quality. Great for portraits, still life, architectural scenes, and literary/thoughtful brand imagery.

## When to Use

- Blog headers that need sophistication without color
- Portraits or character-focused imagery
- When you want a "literary magazine" feel
- Architectural or object studies
- When color would distract from the concept

## Visual Approach

Think New Yorker illustrations, literary magazine artwork, or high-end editorial spreads. The style communicates "thoughtful" and "considered" without saying a word.

**Key characteristics:**
- Clean, high-contrast black and white
- Confident linework with visible hand-drawn quality
- Crosshatching for shading and depth
- Intentional imperfection - not vector-clean
- Strong silhouettes and clear forms

## Technical Direction

```
STYLE: Minimalist ink illustration. High-contrast black and white with hand-drawn quality. Confident linework using crosshatching for shading and texture. Think editorial illustration from a literary magazine - sophisticated but accessible.

RENDERING: Pure black ink on white paper. No gray tones except through crosshatching density. Lines should feel drawn by hand, not generated - slight variation in weight, occasional overlap.

TEXTURE: Visible pen strokes. Crosshatching should vary in density to create depth. Paper texture subtle but present.
```

## Composition Notes

- Strong focal point with clear silhouette
- Use negative space generously - white space is part of the composition
- Crosshatching concentrates in shadow areas, leaving highlights as pure white
- Frame subjects with intention - not centered unless deliberately so

## Example Prompt Structure

```
Create a minimalist ink illustration of [SUBJECT].

CONCEPT: [What are we looking at and what feeling should it evoke?]

STYLE: High-contrast black and white ink illustration. Hand-drawn quality with confident linework. Use crosshatching for shading - denser in shadows, sparse in midtones, pure white for highlights. Think literary magazine or New Yorker editorial art.

COMPOSITION: [Describe framing, focal point, use of negative space]

RENDERING: Pure black ink on white. No gray washes - all tone comes from line density. Linework should feel human - slight imperfections, natural variation in stroke weight.

AVOID: Gray tones, gradients, color of any kind, photorealistic rendering, digital-looking lines, busy backgrounds.

FORMAT: [16:9 / 1:1 / 9:16]
```

## Good Subjects for This Style

- Portraits (contemplative, not smiling)
- Hands holding objects
- Architectural details
- Still life arrangements
- Natural forms (plants, animals, landscapes)
- Objects with interesting silhouettes
