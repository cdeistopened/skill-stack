# About Skill Stack

**The skill of skills. Mastering the only skill that matters - the art of skills.**

Skill Stack is a newsletter and resource hub exploring the meta-skill of skill acquisition itself.

## What is skills.md?

skills.md is a protocol for describing skills in a portable, structured format. Think of it as a resume that actually works - for humans and AI alike.

The protocol provides a standardized way to:
- Define what a skill actually is
- Describe proficiency levels
- Map dependencies between skills
- Share and verify skills across platforms
