## Introduction

*interview-format, physiology, health-science, dr-raymond-peat*

**John Barkhousen:** The following episode of Politics and Science features an interview with Dr. Raymond Peat, endocrinologist and physiologist from Eugene, Oregon. It was recorded on July 24, 2008.

## Cholesterol and Health: The Misunderstood Nutrient

*cholesterol, health-myth, dietary-fat, cardiovascular-health*

**John Barkhousen:** We were discussing fats in our diet and the use of fats by humans over the years and also as animal feed. You mentioned a fellow named Chris Masterjohn, and I thought perhaps we could explore that further. One of the things you said that kind of shocked me was that for years we've heard that cholesterol is something you get from fat, from butter, especially beef fat. We've been told it's poisoning us. But it turns out that perhaps cholesterol isn't the boogeyman we always thought it was. It's actually something we need to function.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, but eating cholesterol, if you're healthy, you have to eat a tremendous amount. There was an experiment where healthy young men ate eggs until they could see an increase in blood cholesterol. It took 22 eggs before they saw a rise in the day's cholesterol. It does rise if you're very sick and can't compensate.

But in a practical situation where a person might want to raise their cholesterol, you can usually do it just by eating lots of fruit. The minerals and sugar in the fruit give the liver the energy it needs to make adequate cholesterol. There's what they call a U-shaped curve of mortality. You have an ideal range of cholesterol for a given age, and when you're below that range, your mortality increases.

**John Barkhousen:** What are those ranges, Raymond?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The published studies usually put the bottom of the U around 160 to 180. But when you look at the figures, the bottom really varies with age. One study looked at people in nursing home situations and found that those with the highest cholesterol—in that group, those with 270—lived the longest. You have to think about the relation of cholesterol to the stress you're under and consider it an anti-stress hormone.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, my father recently was told that he has to start taking statins. A lot of people are on statins. What's your opinion?

---

## The Dark Side of Statin Drugs and Pharmaceutical Influence

*statins, pharmaceutical-marketing, drug-industry-corruption, scientific-integrity*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Years ago they started seeing increased mortality as they used drugs to lower cholesterol. There was a Hungarian study in the 1980s that showed a great increase in cancer mortality as they lowered cholesterol. This accorded with a Veterans Administration study in the 1960s that they stopped when they saw people on the so-called "heart protective low-fat diet" were dying at a higher rate from cancer.

There are still lingering data showing that statins might increase total mortality. But the marketing is so intense that they manage to place articles convincing people how good it is. There was a recent book by Melody Peterson—I think the title is "Our Daily Meds"—that gives a lot of information about how the drug industry manipulates culture.

They've been paying doctors well and writing articles for doctors to sign their names to, then publishing them in prestigious journals to promote their products. This gives inside information about how they're buying the medical literature. Marcia Angell, from her editor's viewpoint at the New England Journal of Medicine, emphasized that editorial decisions can completely bias results.

If people choose not to submit their data because it doesn't support the efficacy of a drug or its safety, a lot of studies simply won't get submitted. Increasingly, the drug industry is modifying the research that gets done, how universities treat their research, how journals publish it, and then how doctors use it. The system is pretty well sewn up now.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anything relating to drug therapy, you just simply can't trust the Anglo-American literature. This influence has spread into Italy, Chile, France, and Japan as the industries become influential in those countries. India and Russia were relatively outside the commercial pharmaceutical influence, but now they're moving in that direction too.

**John Barkhousen:** So it's an effect of globalization, I suppose? Same corporate policies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, still, some of the more backward economies still manage to do some real research.

**John Barkhousen:** We've heard it said that we have one of the most effective propaganda systems in world history at this time, with access to the media pretty much sewn up by the corporations. Alternative voices are only heard on stations like ours, which are community stations. There are quite a few of them around the country, but there's a lot of space in between them.

How's the media situation out in Oregon?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In my lifetime, the Pacifica stations have been the outstanding exceptions. But the university public radio station, about 10 to 15 years ago, changed its format so that students don't have the access they used to. Now it sounds like one of those big city furniture advertising classical music stations.

**John Barkhousen:** It used to be more of a community station.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it used to be a really good station, but the donors made it sound like one of those upper-class, nothing-but-classic-music stations.

**John Barkhousen:** We're trying to maintain that here. We have a pretty small range, but we do have an affiliation with Pacifica and with other community stations around the country. Getting back to cholesterol, you mentioned someone named Chris Masterjohn last time.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I've read several of his articles that are very good. My only disagreement with him is that he persists in believing in essential fatty acids.

---

## Essential Fatty Acids: A Marketing Fiction

*essential-fatty-acids, linoleic-acid, polyunsaturated-fat, disease-mechanism*

**John Barkhousen:** That's something a lot of alternative health people believe in. What's your view on essential fatty acids, just so everybody knows?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, the first claim was that linoleic acid was essential. Then maybe linolenic was added. But already after the Burr studies of the late 1920s and early 1930s, by the 1940s, their disease was shown to be nothing but a vitamin B6 deficiency.

At about the same time, agricultural researchers were showing that linolenic and linoleic acid were causes of brain degeneration, testicular degeneration, infertility, and muscle degeneration. Fish oils around the same time were causing mink degenerative disease. Yellow fat disease was showing up in more and more animals as they were fed fish waste because of an excess of polyunsaturated fats.

Linoleic acid was finally recognized to be essential for cancer, but not at all essential for nutrition. When publicity came out that the original essential fatty acids were essential for cancer, it discouraged marketing in that direction. That's when it shifted to marketing fish oil as the new version of the essential fatty acids. We're now at pretty much the peak of fish oil promotion as the new fatty acids being recommended.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** These are being promoted at higher intake levels to actually function as drugs to supposedly cure a lot of diseases. But the old research going back 40 to 50 years shows that it is simply a temporary suppression of inflammatory symptoms while in the long run increasing inflammatory degenerative processes.

**John Barkhousen:** So the reason people have a subsiding of their symptoms is just their immune system has been knocked down?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** David Horaban, who was a big promoter of polyunsaturated fats and who died of brain cancer, published work showing that fish oil is very immune suppressive. Others looking at why fish oil is anti-inflammatory found that it wasn't the original long-chain polyunsaturated fats found in fish.

When they are processed and hit the hot organs of a mammal, they break down. It's the breakdown products—the aldehydes and free radicals decomposed from the fish oils—that are actually the anti-inflammatory substances. So it's the deterioration of the material that produces temporary relief, but it's also those things that contribute to serious long-range problems such as brain damage and vascular damage.

## Fish Oil Promotion and Hidden Health Risks

*fish-oil, vitamins-a-d, omega-supplements, marketing-deception*

**John Barkhousen:** You were saying last week that fish oil does have some good properties—it has lots of vitamin A and D.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Depends on how it's made. But in its crude form, it does come with a lot of vitamin D and A.

**John Barkhousen:** So if there was some way to get those vitamins out without the harmful fats?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there have been a lot of products on the market extracted from fish liver oil in which they concentrate the vitamin D and A so that you can get your daily dose in a couple drops of the oil.

**John Barkhousen:** And some people are taking fish oil for antidepressant—I think they're called Omega-3s or something like that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been studies even in the published literature about whether it's effective as an antidepressant. The ones I've seen were about an equal number saying it isn't effective as say it is effective. Same with using it as a supplement in baby food. There are studies showing that it retards infant brain development, even though they don't get discussed very much.

**John Barkhousen:** Is that the DHA?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**John Barkhousen:** And they've started adding that to baby food. Oh dear. How did we get on fish oil, Raymond? You remember?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, it's being promoted as an essential nutrient.

**John Barkhousen:** That's right. And so flaxseed oil has gone out of fashion. I didn't realize that. Now they're promoting mostly fish oil in the alternative medicine field.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think so, yeah. The literature in the 1980s just became overwhelming showing that linoleic acid in particular is really the basic engine for pushing cancer excess. Linolenic isn't quite as bad. So flax is as bad as some of the others.

## Government Capture: FDA and Regulatory Corruption

*fda-corruption, regulatory-capture, nuclear-industry, government-liability*

**John Barkhousen:** We're talking to Dr. Raymond Peat. If anybody would like to ask Dr. Peat a question, I can receive emails. If essential fatty acids are not only essential for creating disease, how is it that they're so heavily promoted by the government?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several years ago the FDA had a warning not to use more than three grams a day of long-chain unsaturated fats from fish oil. I think they've dropped that warning, or at least it isn't prominent like it used to be. I think right from the FDA's very beginning, it was captured by the food industry and then the drug industry. Now they really are working primarily as a corporate defense system.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, it always seems like they absorb the liability for the corporations. If they approve it, then you can't sue the corporation.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the same thing as government protecting the nuclear industry by saying you can't collect more than a certain amount of damages if you have a reactor explode in your neighborhood.

**John Barkhousen:** So basically the nuclear industry is underwritten by the government.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The Public Health Service has a worse record than the FDA itself. The FDA interfaces with consumers and tries to keep them happy. But at higher levels, the government agencies have been more defensive of the power structure, pretty much ignoring the consumer level.

During the years of fallout from atmospheric bomb testing, the Public Health Service was destroying data and putting out false data about the safety of radiation. This is very telling of how the government can work at its worst.

---

## Radiation Exposure: The Bystander Effect

*radiation-damage, bystander-effect, cellular-mutation, toxic-environment*

**John Barkhousen:** Maybe you could talk about radiation for a minute and how the government's bias towards that has made it more widespread.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For 50 or 60 years, I've been hearing from dentists and doctors that the dose we give you in examining you is very small and harmless. Then they reduce it tenfold and say exactly the same thing. The words are the same from 1940, 1950, right down to the current. They claim they have digitalized machines. People think it's just bits of information coming through their bodies, but it's still the same old X-rays, exciting their cells.

Even Linus Pauling took a less than adequate biological view when warning about the dangers. He was looking only at DNA damage. But the damage is much subtler than breaking strands of DNA. The excited electrons cause chemical and physiological changes that linger, completely distinct from the immediate reaction of radiation with DNA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** For example, you can give a dose of radiation to cells in a dish and then add new cells that weren't exposed to radiation to that dish. The new cells will start mutating a day or more later from something emitted by the exposed cells. That process lingers in the tissues and blood serum and is called the bystander effect.

You can demonstrate in the lab that cells that weren't exposed start behaving as if they were exposed by contact with the damaged cells. People exposed from the Hiroshima bomb have been studied 60 years later, and they still showed essentially excited electronic states in their tissues. The same with people, about 20 years after the Chernobyl exposure—their serum is still toxic. It can be removed from their blood and added to healthy cells, and the healthy cells begin mutating.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** So it's the bystander effect, which lingers and might continue causing mutations. But it's a completely separate process from mutation itself. The safety assumptions were based on the model of how a beam of radiation affects a molecule. It was worked out in terms of direct interaction between a molecule and radiation, but in the organism, that simply isn't how it works.

Russians way back in the 1960s were showing that when the Western paradigm said irradiating an animal's brain would cause estrus by supposedly altering the pituitary to produce more estrogen, the Russians did a control experiment where they irradiated the animal's foot instead of its brain, and it went into estrus. So it's some kind of radiation toxin emitted by the exposed tissue.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** But it's the same thing that happens in the bystander effect—some physiological, biochemical change started by radiation that then spreads and continues. The increased estrogen happens to imitate these processes started by the radiation. So there are probably many levels, from the single cell emitting bystander-acting substances to the whole organism in which estrogen becomes one of the bystander-activating substances.

**John Barkhousen:** So you're saying a little bit of radiation causes this cascading effect throughout the body?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Two or three years ago in Seattle, they were using low-level, fancy, latest, well-calibrated X-ray equipment and covering patients with lead aprons, and they found that a full set of dental X-rays, if the woman was pregnant at the time, even though her body was shielded thoroughly, her baby turned out underweight—showing basically the same effects as taking a dose of estrogen while pregnant. It spreads a stress influence that malnourishes the developing fetus and causes its brain to develop less folate than an unexposed fetus.

---

## Scientific Empiricism vs Dogmatic Modeling

*scientific-method, empiricism, dogmatism, in-vitro-research, modeling*

**John Barkhousen:** How the government assessed the dangers of radiation poisoning was interesting. They had a hypothetical theory about how one molecule would be affected by ionizing radiation, but they didn't take into account the living system. I think you've said before that's common in how science is conducted in the West—they do a lot of experiments in test tubes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And worse than that. If you look through PubMed, you see lots of abstracts described as in vitro. But now they have the concept "in silico."

**John Barkhousen:** What does that mean?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It means they didn't have anything living at all. It was all done in a computer. But people read the article, and they're used to seeing "in vitro," so they think real cells were involved. But in silico means in the computer.

**John Barkhousen:** I've never heard that before. What's wrong with doing that? I guess that's modeling basically, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It's like the medieval arguments about angels—how much floor space does an angel need to dance, and how many can get on the head of a pin? Unless something worse than meaningless. It is a way of amplifying your favorite hypothesis or assumption.

**John Barkhousen:** It'll actually promote some absolutely wrong theory if you do your modeling.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Right.

**John Barkhousen:** In studying science, I think a lot of people are confused that we just figure it's empirical and they're testing theories all the time. The best theory should end up on top because it'll get the most positive results. How come that isn't the way it works?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Lots of reasons, but probably the basic thing is that it's all filtered through the culture and the system of assumptions. The assumptions vary greatly if you look at different cultures. The whole background of philosophy and religion influences what you think can be taken seriously as an assumption.

In medieval times, people believed in alchemy and the influence of planets and astrology. So ordinary chemists and physiologists think it's absurd to consider the phase of the moon when doing a chemical or biological study. But several people have looked at lab results over a period of time and have seen that the phase of the moon does influence many experiments in the lab.

---

## Lunar Cycles and the Problem of Hidden Variables

*lunar-cycles, laboratory-biology, environmental-influence, experimental-design*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I worked in the hamster lab at the university where the indoor temperature was kept constant and the light was artificially controlled so a person would not have any cues indoors whether it was winter or summer. But somehow the hamsters knew what was going on outside the walls because their thymuses would atrophy in the winter season and come back in the spring, just like they do when they're exposed to changing daylight.

Professor Brown in Indiana did many tests with potatoes, oysters, and flowering plants. He had noticed that his experiments varied with the moon. He got some oysters from the east coast and studied their metabolism in Indiana. If it had been genetically determined the way the paradigm said it must be—because hamsters can't know when it's winter if you're controlling their lights—it must be some kind of genetically operated clock in their brains.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** But Brown took his oysters to Indiana, and they were still metabolically cycling as if the tides were coming into Indiana. He did the same thing with potatoes, which aren't susceptible to tides. So no one knew about monthly cycles in potatoes. But he saw a similar metabolic moon cycle in potato metabolism and flowering plants.

He could take one of these plants that opens its petals at dawn and closes them at sunset. Taking it indoors, they still kept up the same cycle. He took it into a big building where no cues from the outside apparently reached, and they still did it. He took his plants into a mine shaft, and they kept cycling until they got down—I forget, I think it was hundreds of feet below the surface. The plants finally didn't receive a cue and no longer cycled.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He demonstrated that something lunar or planetary influence was able to penetrate hundreds of feet of shielding. When properly shielded, his plants no longer cycled, disproving the idea that it's a genetic clock. Other people were able to train plants to move their leaves at different times of day by giving them cues that overrode the environmental cues, again disproving that it's all controlled by an abstract genetic clock.

## Genetics as Religious Dogma, Not Science

*genetics-dogma, lamarck-evolution, acquired-traits, environmental-inheritance*

**John Barkhousen:** So you're saying that genetics is a dogma that's been pretty much accepted by the culture as truth.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it really is primarily a kind of religious belief. Remember the Lamarck-Cuvier controversy? The person who took over the museum that Lamarck had been the director of for years did so when Lamarck was doing his work showing the inheritance of acquired traits. The man that took over was a Christian catastrophist who basically said there was no evolution—it was accounted for by a flood destroying the ancient species.

In history, genetics as an anti-environmental approach was strictly a biblical orientation against the Lamarckian environmentalist orientation.

**John Barkhousen:** I always thought the genetic orientation was very convenient for liability in terms of anybody causing environmental damage, whether to your own body in terms of pollution, or to the environment in general. If you can't directly link them in a simple cause and effect, they can always just say it's genetics.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has been very convenient for the medical profession for the last 50 or 60 years. It's either genetic or it's a virus, and there's nothing you can do to expect the cure. Especially with cancer, the government was very influential in reinforcing that interpretation. That's closely related to military medical research.

The germ warfare people were getting government subsidies, and they were inclined to the "it's your own fault for having bad genes" theory. Much of the research was done to say that the military didn't cause the problems. Environmentalism in cancer research simply couldn't get funding after about 1945.

---

## Military Research and Cancer Paradigm Shift

*military-research, germ-warfare, cancer-research, fort-detrick, paradigm-shift*

**John Barkhousen:** Not since 1945?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was persisting into the early 1950s, but it's pretty much at the end of the Second World War that the whole school of biology was simply defunded and put out of existence. The idea that embryos develop according to a field—a developmental field and gradient—was the dominant theory along with the idea that cancer is a metabolic physiological field distortion. Embryology and cancer were related to these metabolic and pattern-based ideas.

The genetics and militaristic approach simply cut those off. The best research was done through the 1930s, and the war itself interrupted a lot of the research. But when the government came out of the war having funded the Manhattan Project, that sort of money was then directed into germ warfare research.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It gradually shifted to so-called cancer research. The Fort Detrick germ warfare lab simply changed its name while not doing very different research when it shifted over to the war against cancer.

**John Barkhousen:** So these cultural beliefs that seem to be directing research and taking some theories as truth and rejecting other theories regardless of the empirical evidence—they are basically also responsible for the misinformation we've heard about cholesterol.

---

## Cholesterol Receptors and the Thyroid Connection

*cholesterol-receptors, thyroid-hormone, receptor-theory, genetic-marketing*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, in different ways. They talk about genetically determined tendencies towards high cholesterol that you can see in the form of cholesterol receptors. The whole idea of a receptor is a genetic pharmacological idea. It's very much like the ads you see on TV where a drug zooms around in your body and goes right to the place where it's needed. The receptor idea is like a switch that turns on a gene.

There are molecules that drugs and substances stick to, and those, if they have any involvement in physiology, are called the receptor. But that is promoted as a genetically determined thing. One drug company was collecting genes from a village in the Mediterranean area where people didn't have heart disease and trying to promote gene change as a drug product. But the environmental influences simply weren't of interest.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If you can identify a problem as a permanent genetic feature of the patient and then work on that gene receptor with a drug, then you've got a product. But the cholesterol receptors are regulated by hormones such as the thyroid. If a person doesn't have enough of the receptor, so-called, that takes cholesterol out of your blood, you can take thyroid and increase the amount of that receptor. But that doesn't please anyone.

---

## Thyroid Hormone: From Armour to Synthroid

*thyroid-hormone, synthetic-drug, armour-thyroid, t3-t4, pharmaceutical-marketing*

**John Barkhousen:** I know a lot of people who do take thyroid, and there's several products on the market—Synthroid, Cytomel, Cynoplus. All of these are aimed at their thyroid hormone, which basically gets your thyroid jump-started a bit.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1930s, the main product was made by the Armour Meat Company, which became the Armour Pharmaceutical Company because they had a lot of beef and pork thyroids that they didn't know what to do with. So they would sell those, or the ovaries, or adrenals, or whatever wasn't popular as meat. They would dehydrate and sell as a drug product.

In the 1930s, that was the standard treatment. The symptoms of hypothyroidism were identified, and when they would give them Armour thyroid containing both T4 and T3, the symptoms would be alleviated. But after the war, a company came on the market with purified Thyroxine, which is only a fraction of a fraction of the Armour thyroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The thyroid contains a protein, and then it liberates the two thyroid substances, T4 and T3. But T4 is released by the gland about four times as much as the active T3. When conditions are right—when the environment is right—the liver completes the activation so that most of your thyroid function is really coming from the liver, which is an interface with the environment. When your nutrition calls for it, then your liver produces 70 or 80% of the active thyroid hormone.

But after the war, the drug companies had an interest in promoting a product. So they said the main substance and the easiest to make was Thyroxine, and they gave it to 25-year-old male medical students—very healthy people. They said it works just like real thyroid in these healthy young men. But they didn't test it in sick people or in women. Women's livers are much less active than men because of the effect of estrogen. A certain amount of alcohol takes longer for a woman to eliminate from the body than in a man. So the liver in general is less active in females, but the drug product Thyroxine was sold across the board even though it had only been tested in young men.

---

## Thyroid Testing Paradigms and Clinical Oversight

*thyroid-testing, protein-bound-iodine, thyroid-stimulating-hormone, diagnostic-bias*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It was more than 10 years later that the real active hormone T3 came on the market. It wasn't even known at the time that thyroid supplement was being marketed as Thyroxine. The tests that determined whether you were hypothyroid or not disregarded all of the symptoms that had been associated with hypothyroidism up until about 1945.

The tests at first measured only the iodine bound to protein, which has very little to do with your thyroid function. According to those tests, the Thyroxine product would raise your protein-bound iodine. So that was compatible with marketing the synthetic drug. But after about 20 years, they saw that the protein-bound iodine test had almost nothing to do with your thyroid function. If you ate seaweed, you would get a lot of protein-bound iodine, but your thyroid function would go down.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They started looking for new ways to test the thyroid. But they had established over those 20 years that instead of half of the population benefiting from thyroid, the tests suggested that only 5% of the people would benefit from thyroid. So whatever new test came on the market, the assumption had been established in the culture that only about 5% would need thyroid.

Any new test has been standardized to that paradigm of looking at a percentage of the population rather than whether the substance cures symptoms. Now they are treating the thyroid stimulating hormone level and disregarding the actual effect of the hormone on the person's health and physiology.

**John Barkhousen:** So they're basically treating one of the markers instead of the actual problem. Yeah, that seems to happen a lot in medicine—they start mistaking the marker for the actual problem.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And they call it "subclinical" and don't even make explicit what they mean by clinical.

---

## AIDS, Viral Load Tests, and the Drug Industry

*aids-testing, viral-load, peter-duesberg, drug-paradigm, disease-causation*

**John Barkhousen:** The AIDS test, I think, is something like that, isn't it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. There have been several traditional drugs that alleviate symptoms, but those tend to be suppressed or forgotten. But the so-called virus has attracted very little attention. What they're doing now is using a lab process to amplify a substance that relates to the virus. It isn't the actual virus, but they call it the viral load. It's something they create in the laboratory, and meanwhile they ignore traditional drugs or consider them simply additional therapies that could be added to the valuable and profitable drugs that they use to treat the people.

**John Barkhousen:** I was going to talk to you about Chris Masterjohn's experience with cholesterol today, but maybe we'll save that for another day. You were going to say something else about the AIDS drugs.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are a couple very good books. One is "Impending the AIDS Virus" by Peter Duesberg, and the other is by Harvey Bialy about Peter Duesberg and the virus and disease. I've been following it now for, I guess, 20 years. The establishment people just don't want to talk about it. They won't let these people publish responses to articles in the major journals. So the average doctor reading it thinks they have no answer, but it's just that the editors don't want to hear their answer.

The mainstream virus theory of AIDS people have never answered the criticisms of Peter Duesberg, who basically says the virus is harmless.

**John Barkhousen:** And that begs the question—what's causing the harm?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He thinks it's a drug. I'm inclined to the idea that it's the interaction of drugs, polyunsaturated fats, radiation exposure, and other toxins in the environment.

**John Barkhousen:** So that would be another case of an environmental problem.

---

## Environmental Health Crisis: Cumulative Toxins

*environmental-toxins, radiation, drug-exposure, polyunsaturated-fats, disease-causation*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. When you graph the incidence over the last 60 years of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, it's a straight progressive increase since the bomb tests began after the Second World War. There was no sudden jump at the time AIDS became official as a disease—it's a steady increase going back 60 years.

**John Barkhousen:** That's very interesting. Well, we're just about out of time. We've been talking to Dr. Raymond Peat from Eugene, Oregon. He's a physiologist and an endocrinologist and puts out a newsletter called Ray Peat Newsletter. You can find him online where you have a lot of excellent articles—getting more and more articles up there. I've noticed it too.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I have another 10 or 15 that will go up in a couple of weeks, I hope.

**John Barkhousen:** Great. Well, they're very interesting. Even if you don't necessarily agree with everything that's said there, plenty of food for thought and a lot of medical history and scientific history that I certainly have never heard about before. So I find it all fascinating. Thanks, Ray, for your work.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay.

**John Barkhousen:** We'll talk to you soon. Bye.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Bye.
