## Opening Context
*coronavirus-pandemic, medical-advice, independent-analysis*

**John Barkhousen:** Hey and welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host, John Barkhousen. This week we return to part two of our conversation with Ray Peat. This was recorded on 24th March 2020 and we are discussing the Coronavirus COVID-19, which has caused a lockdown in the United States in many areas due to its expected high contagion rate and potentially very serious mortality rate.

So I hope you find this show informative. It's not intended as medical advice—it's just an independent analysis of what's going on. Ray Peat has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon. He specialized in physiology and hormones. His newsletter is available at raypeat.com where you can read many archived newsletters and subscribe to get on his mailing list for new newsletters, which come out every other month.

Thanks for coming back on Politics and Science today, Ray. I'm always a pleasure to talk to you.

## Questioning the Pandemic Narrative
*skepticism, evidence, virologists, alternative-perspectives*

**John Barkhousen:** We're in the midst of this coronavirus so-called pandemic that's been declared by the World Health Organization and the CDC. Everybody is having a hard time and is very scared about what's going on. I just listened to a podcast today with a New York Times reporter talking to an epidemiologist saying it's going to be very bad and we're not taking enough across-the-board measures. It's too piecemeal—the states are doing it individually and there needs to be strong federal action to make sure everybody's staying home and behaving themselves and not getting close enough to transmit the coronavirus. I wonder what your take is on that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I still am not convinced that anything special is happening. Did we talk about the German virologist Wolfgang Wodarg?

**John Barkhousen:** No, we didn't. We didn't yet.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, he is a well-known expert in pulmonology and viruses. As of the last time I checked on his website, he still wasn't convinced that anything different from previous years is happening. He showed that in previous years, from 5 to 15% of lung infections were caused by some type of coronavirus.

So far this one hasn't really been proven to be much more virulent or much more infectious. But they've jumped to the conclusion that it is both more harmful and spreads faster. But you can't find that in the evidence. According to Wodarg, another well-known German pulmonologist and virologist named Bhakti says similar things. He says that the country is causing very considerable damage economically and harming especially older people by the measures they're introducing without any real evidence that anything special is happening.

Another well-known epidemiologist, John Ioannidis, who has various positions at Stanford, says this might be one of history's greatest evidence fiascos because they're talking about just fragments of evidence and drawing huge conclusions and then taking unprecedented political and economic actions against no clear scientific evidence.

**John Barkhousen:** Could you spell the German virologists' and pulmonologists' names just so people can look up their evidence?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The first one was Wolfgang Wodarg, last name W-O-D-A-R-G. The second guy's name, last name is spelled B-A-K-H-T-I.

**John Barkhousen:** And then you said the guy at Stanford, John.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Ioannidis. I-O-A-N-N-I-D-I-S.

## Political and Economic Response to Pandemic
*trump, foreign-policy, isolationism, corporate-bailout, monopoly*

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. And they're saying that the Trump administration isn't doing enough.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've always been considered crazy for pointing out that Trump in many ways has been less harmful than the so-called progressives like Obama, in that he tends to be withdrawing from wars, for example. I'm inclined to see his reluctance to go ahead with the war on the virus as another virtue, even though everyone considers that crazy.

The Pentagon wanted to go back into Iraq heavily in retaliation against a couple of soldiers getting killed. He used the virus as an excuse—an argument against renewing the war in Iraq. Even though he's been criticized for everything he does against the grain, I think he's justified by the evidence.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. In these cases, it's too bad he doesn't do himself any favors in his social behavior.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, it's too bad. Too bad he isn't a pleasanter personality to do some reasonable things.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. And he has a sort of the personality of a gangster, at least he sounds like one to me. But I think you're right. He has an isolationist tendency when it comes to wars and I'm all for that myself.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And he proposes to stop the clampdown on society by Easter, which he's being criticized for again. The so-called health experts are saying that's foolish and dangerous to consider restoring freedom in just two weeks.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, I mean I can understand why people are scared if you listen to any news at all. It's just one dire warning after the next. But I'm interested in the reports from Italy where people over 65 aren't being allowed to have a ventilator, and people are doing triage and some people are being basically told they'll have to die.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it already is causing unemployment and it's being taken as an opportunity. Bernanke and Yellen proposed that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department join up so that the taxpayers will be made responsible for everything that the Fed does and that they will then bail out big corporations at their choice.

But what it leads to is super corporations guaranteed by the government and the taxpayers but no guarantees to the employees of middle-sized and small companies. So it's like pushing towards total monopoly. All of the proposals I've seen lead in that direction—giving money to bail out the big banks and corporations, which is like a war against small businesses.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, that's right. And you know, Naomi Klein has written about this extensively in her book "Disaster Capitalism" where she cites a lot of examples of this in the past. And this seems like a combination of disaster capitalism and fascism. Because I think the definition of fascism is the combination of corporate and federal power.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, exactly. Except that as it's going, it bypasses some of the nastiness of Hitlerism and Mussolini's fascism and goes right directly to giving orders around the world to stop protests, interfere with elections, and so on. Like the yellow vests in France aren't able to go into the streets as they've been doing for a year. They are allowed to put their vests out on the balcony or in their windows, not as protest, but basically it's already established total quiescence and control politically.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. And it's very effective. If you make everybody very afraid, then it's not just government force like Hitler was trying to use or Mussolini. It's pure pressure.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Much, much smoother and more effective.

**John Barkhousen:** We start policing ourselves. Yeah. And I feel like a lot of this is pushing towards once they have everybody scared. I see a lot of talk on social media about if only we had a vaccine that would save us from this coronavirus.

## Inflammation Over Infection: The Real Danger
*oxygen-treatment, inflammation, co2, elderly-susceptibility, immune-response*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I saw a little video from a hospital in Bergamo and it looked like they were stuffing people in the oxygen tents and putting oxygen masks on them. If people come in with a minor respiratory ailment and they're 70, 80, or 90 years old and they get put into a pure oxygen atmosphere, that's exactly the wrong thing to do.

But it's what almost all the hospitals in the world are doing, thinking they need oxygen because they're having trouble breathing. So they give them pure oxygen. But carbon dioxide is anti-inflammatory. When you give them pure oxygen five times more than normal, you're tremendously displacing the natural balance of carbon dioxide, which is anti-inflammatory in our breath.

Several good research projects have found that if you hypoventilate people who are having some problem in the hospital—like surgery—slight hypoventilation to let the CO2 build up reduces inflammation and produces much better outcomes overall. Because inflammation is such a pathogen in any kind of sickness, and especially in this particular virus infection or any lung infection, the symptoms are basically inflammatory.

The angiotensin system, the interferon system, which turns on other inflammatory agents, histamine—all of the defensive reactions triggered by these respiratory infections amplify inflammation and that causes the congestion, constriction, swelling, and exudation of serum into the lungs. Instead of a balanced moisture economy in the lungs, the serum and proteins in the blood ooze out into the lung space and interfere with breathing.

Anything you do to increase inflammation is going to increase that pneumonia tendency and general sickness. So oxygen and many of the virus-idle chemicals they're given greatly intensify inflammation. That's one of the reasons old people are so susceptible. About 85% of the infected, proven infected people have almost no symptoms of infection. The main ones who react badly and get very sick or die are mostly the very old people who already have some kind of degenerative, circulatory, or inflammatory kind of disease—heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and so on.

The changes of aging that caused the circulatory problems are essentially overactivity of the immune system—sort of a variation on the autoimmune thing, but it's a general tissue degenerative process that exaggerates the inflammatory processes. In one study where they gave a type of coronavirus known to produce common cold symptoms and put this into volunteers' noses, they found that the people with pre-existing inflammatory problems were the ones that reacted more seriously to the virus.

In mice studies, they find that the given virus does very little damage to the young animals. The older the animal is with a more mature immune system, the more harmful the virus is. So in this situation, the so-called immune defenses are really the instrument by which the virus is damaging the organism.

---

## How Viruses Spread Successfully
*viral-transmission, diarrhea, cough, evolutionary-success*

**John Barkhousen:** So it's the reaction of the organism to the virus, to the virus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The successful virus which these are succeeds by, if possible, causing something like chronic diarrhea and a chronic cough. If the person stays well enough to go around living normally but coughing, that's good for the virus to spread. So a successful virus doesn't kill many of its infected hosts—it causes them to spread the virus rather than die.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, I was going to ask you that. It would make sense for the longevity of the virus not to kill its host.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And diarrhea, coughing, and spitting are typical ways a virus will spread.

**John Barkhousen:** So if you're already inflamed and the virus comes along and attacks your cells, then you're much more likely to have an overreaction and an over-immune reaction. That reminds me of socially or politically what we're doing right now. If what you're saying is correct, then we're having an overreaction to the threat of this virus which could potentially cause a lot of damage to our society.

## Vaccine Efficacy and Historical Failures
*swine-flu, vaccine-failure, cdc-director, public-health-error*

**John Barkhousen:** And I was wondering if you could speak about the efficacy of vaccines in terms of flu and this virus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The great swine flu pandemic that didn't exist. The man in charge of influenza vaccines at the CDC at that time was supervisor of that department. He pointed out to his superiors repeatedly over several months that the time it takes to develop any of these flu vaccines is usually a year to a year and a half.

By that time, the flu germ has spread, reached its peak, and disappeared. People are naturally immune to that particular strain by the time the vaccine comes on the market. And he lost his job for going on television talking on Phil Donahue, I think it was. That got him fired.

And then later, 60 Minutes did a detailed analysis of the failure of the epidemic. One soldier was confirmed to have died of the flu virus. No one else in the world, by the admission of the head of the CDC, but hundreds died from the vaccine. So now when someone says that vaccines are confirmed not only to be useless but to be dangerous and in many cases worse than the disease that they can't conceivably be produced in time to prevent, those people are now being called quacks.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. Now, in the history of vaccines, there have been useful ones, right? In the past.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. When it's an organism that doesn't change faster than the vaccine can be produced. Smallpox was probably the best example of a vaccine being able to totally abolish a disease when it's used intelligently. They would identify where the outbreaks were and then form a ring of vaccinated people around those outbreaks and let the disease run its course inside that ring. Repeatedly doing that, they closed in and eradicated the vaccine from nature.

---

## Intelligent Vaccination Strategy and Costs
*smallpox-eradication, targeted-vaccination, economic-efficiency*

**John Barkhousen:** Because that particular disease was a virus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**John Barkhousen:** So it just didn't mutate quickly so they could get a handle on it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And I think other diseases are probably slow enough to change that they could be treated similarly. If the effort were made, they could close in on them and eliminate them for a relatively small price. The cost for eliminating smallpox on a world scale was microscopic compared to the annual expense on measles and the standard array of vaccines that kids are getting in the United States and most other countries.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. And I think you said the cost now is $4.5 billion a year just for vaccines for children.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**John Barkhousen:** That's stupendous. And maybe not that effective.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** How do you rate their efficacy since they're stupidly used trying to vaccinate the whole world rather than closing in on the virus? When you have an outbreak at Disney World, for example, you can track those people and vaccinate everyone around them. 1000 people for everyone vaccinated will have avoided the vaccine. The vaccines have a consistent and predictable rate of damage and harm—mortality, paralysis, brain damage, autism is one of the outcomes.

But no one really denies the government pays at least a proportion of the people they harm. They acknowledge that they're doing harm, but instead of intelligently reducing the number of people given the vaccine, they prefer to pay for a stupid use of vaccines that otherwise could be effective.

## Vaccine Safety Testing: Adjuvants and Fraud
*vaccine-safety, adjuvants, aluminum-hydroxide, testing-fraud*

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, and that makes sense to me. And the testing is of questionable merit.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The safety testing is absolutely crooked. Some of the vaccines with the known harmful adjuvants—aluminum hydroxide—is added because it causes a systemic inflammatory reaction. And so that's the most harmful, more harmful than the germ itself. But when they're testing the safety of a vaccine, you would expect that they would test the safety of the combination of aluminum hydroxide and the other junk that goes along with the actual antigen.

But in some of the studies, they gave the adjuvant to the control group as well as the test group. So they're creating a certain level of damage in their control group and comparing that to the damage in the complete vaccine. I can't think of any way that a person could design that experiment without intending to defraud.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. And just so people know, the adjuvant is the addition to the weakened vaccine or the weakened virus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The adjuvant. After using aluminum hydroxide to produce that general inflammatory reaction that revs up your ability to produce antibodies, after using that for generations, it's gradually becoming recognized by the people suing the government for brain damage and death and so on. It is developing a bad reputation.

So they're looking for new adjuvants—things that will do just as much inflammatory damage but don't yet have the bad reputation that aluminum hydroxide does. But the same thing will occur with these lipid-based nano particles of lipids used as antigens. After another 50 years, those will develop a bad reputation.

**John Barkhousen:** You mean you can't actually stimulate an inflammatory reaction without damaging the organism?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, that's probably a major, if not the only motor of the aging process—the accumulated damage done by interacting with irritating, stressful parts of the environment. Your body changes with every encounter. The more of an adjuvant function that the environment imposes on your body, the bigger reaction it forces you to make, the greater the change in your life course is.

We're in a constantly revising process as we develop and age. These systemic reactions for every encounter—foods we eat and digest and assimilate properly—even those are adding to our immunological burden. So to deliberately increase the activity of the immune system is to deliberately accelerate the process of aging and degenerating.

## Routes of Immunization: Natural vs Injection
*vaccination-methods, dermal-application, immune-response, professionalism*

**John Barkhousen:** I see. So in the history of vaccines, in your recent newsletter which is available at raypeat.com, you mentioned a fellow named John Williamson called Johnny Notions. And so how did his vaccines work if they didn't have this adjuvant?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The smallpox vaccine all by itself is irritating enough. It doesn't need an adjuvant. And he weakened his just by reasoning. He reasoned that if he could weaken a deadly something—they didn't have any idea of what viruses were at that time—but if he could weaken this nasty material, he put it in smoke.

He would take pus or scab from a person with smallpox and smoke it for a while and then pack it under leaves. And a layer of camphor and then buried it for years, letting chemical processes happen. This was in the 1700s, so almost nothing was known about how chemistry works. But he intuited that he was doing something to weaken and change the agent.

And then he would introduce it into the skin, not into the muscle or under the skin. But he had a very fine tool he made that would split the skin so it went into the living material but didn't reach the blood. And all of his people were made immune. He vaccinated thousands. None of them died from the vaccine as they would have from a modern vaccine.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, and that sounds a lot more gentle in that it's not being injected into your bloodstream. What's the difference between a dermal application like that, a skin application, and having something injected into your bloodstream?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. In the last 10 years or so, a few alternative doctors were practicing it 30 or 40 years ago, rubbing it into the skin gently rather than injecting it. But experiments now in the last 10 years have shown that when you take a particular antigen and either take it by inhalation or ingestion, or rubbing it into the skin, or injecting it carefully intradermally, the systemic results are absolutely different from when you inject it into the blood or into the muscle or even under the skin.

The immune system is designed to react in a maximally appropriate way when things get rubbed into the skin or inhaled or eaten. When you bypass those normal routes of infection, we don't have an evolved immune system for proper reactions to needle injections into the muscles. The whole thing about using needles seems to have been a matter of professionalism.

In the 1800s, doctors were the only ones who could have access to needles and syringes. They were technologically beyond the public. And so they created or claimed to have a monopoly on what they said was the most effective way for giving medication. Instead of the crude old-fashioned way of having people eat or inhale the medicine, they would give it by needle in your muscle or directly into your bloodstream. There never was any valid scientific basis for giving medications by injection.

## Innate vs Adaptive Immunity: Beyond Antibody Theory
*innate-immunity, antibody-theory, adaptive-immunity, paul-ehrlich*

**John Barkhousen:** And so you said it's radically different. If you take it through a more natural way where you do have actually a defense, can you still get the same vaccine reaction adequately enough?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reaction is more organized. What they get from the injected reaction is largely a reaction to the tissue damage, leading to autoimmune type reactions—more reactions against your tissues than against the antigen. But in the process, the antigen can be taken down by these specific antibodies.

But that whole antibody theory of immunity is essentially a superstructure built on ignorance of how the immune system works. The antibody theory came about more than 100 years ago with the lock-and-key idea of Paul Ehrlich, which was a way to sell chemical drugs by arguing that he would have a specific chemical for the specific lock. The chemical key was so specific that a particular drug would cure it. And the antibody became the model for the equivalent of a specific drug cure.

And the antibody-based immune theory has been given a series of Nobel prizes at the end of the last century. But since then, most of the knowledge of the real immune system—the innate immune system—is intricable. They used to say that only the antibody system was a real adaptive process, but they simply weren't looking at the adaptive processes at the other tissue levels.

---

## Building a Healthy Innate Immune System
*innate-immunity, allergies, health-optimization, inflammatory-experiences*

**John Barkhousen:** Hmm. So since the flu and viruses adapt too quickly for vaccines to be useful against them, it sounds like we really should depend on the innate immune system. How do we get the innate immune system to work for us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Making people healthy, exposing them to fewer vaccines as they grow up, is, I think, a very important part of it. Allergic people are known to be the ones who react the worst to the coronaviruses. The changes—the degenerative or autoimmune changes—that happen with aging make a person more susceptible to harm from the otherwise mild coronaviruses.

But just being allergic or already having an activated interferon system makes you more susceptible. So the person who can have an abundant, energetic metabolism but without a lot of inflammatory experiences can produce the most organized and almost unnoticed rejection of the infection. The 80% of the people who don't know that they're infected with this particular coronavirus—they are the ones with a good immune system. They don't react noticeably.

---

## Inflammatory Mediators: Interferon, Serotonin, and Histamine
*interferon, nitric-oxide, serotonin, histamine, inflammatory-response*

**John Barkhousen:** And at the beginning you spoke of a lung infection being inflammatory and triggering the angiotensin, interferon, and histamine reactions. You covered some of the angiotensin problem last week. But you haven't mentioned anything about how the interferon and histamine systems would react with the coronavirus.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** One of the main things that the interferon system does is to activate the production of nitric oxide, which in vitro is a very good virus killer. It's a free radical that will destroy just about anything. But in vivo, there have been comparisons with coronavirus.

Nerve infection is a major target of some coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses as an alternate target, causing encephalitis. In experimental infections with nerve-targeted coronaviruses, they find that blocking interferons—production of nitric oxide—prevents death of the animal. And it's specifically the interferon production of nitric oxide that's killing them. I think analogous things are probably happening. It does kill the virus, but it also helps to kill the host.

And same with serotonin. Serotonin is produced by any inflammation and blocking the effects of serotonin. For example, the Chinese are using cinanserin, a serotonin blocker, as one of their tools against the coronavirus.

**John Barkhousen:** Can you spell that again, Ray? Cinanserin.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** C-I-N-A-N-S-E-R-I-N.

**John Barkhousen:** And so that's actually cutting down. So serotonin is an inflammatory chemical that we make when we're under stress.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**John Barkhousen:** Serotonin is talking about the veins tightening up. And so does angiotensin do the same thing. What's the purpose of those in a healthy creature?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The tightening of some of the circulatory system helps to raise the pressure and get more blood to an area where the problem is. So it's just one of many emergency functions. In general, I think it's appropriate to think of these inflammatory things as wound healing agents.

If you have a hole punched in you, these are very appropriate for making the organism direct its healing efforts to the place where the wound is and accelerating the cell growth and attracting cells to the area to repair it. But when you have them spreading out from your lungs, for example, into the whole organism, the whole organism is suffering because that particular type of repair system can be so damaging when it takes place in the lungs.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. So it's an ecology. And it's only supposed to be present for a short time while it's doing its emergency work. Yeah, I kind of understand that. And histamine, how does that fit in?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It tends to be that any injury causes it to be released. The experiments with coronavirus show that it sensitizes the tissues to histamine. So any injury that's releasing histamine becomes more harmful in the presence of the virus. Estrogen is something in the background of all of these.

Angiotensin increases and activates aromatase to make estrogen. So estrogen is coming up in the background of any of these injuries. Stress and estrogen increase production, attract mast cells that make histamine and activate its release, and that intensifies the exudation of fluid into the lungs, for example.

## The ACE2 System: Youth, Protection, and Therapeutics
*ace2, angiotensin-system, progesterone, aspirin, vitamins*

**John Barkhousen:** And one question I had from last week is—you said that in the angiotensin cycle, why don't you describe briefly the cycle again of how angiotensin is made and then how its inflammatory syndrome is stopped?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, first the renin enzyme is one of the starting things. Angiotensinogen—stress and things like estrogen—make the liver produce more angiotensinogen, which is a protein cleaved by renin, the enzyme largely from the kidney. The product of this is called angiotensin 1. And then an enzyme, ACE—angiotensin converting enzyme number one—produces angiotensin 2, acting on the product of the renin.

Angiotensin 2 is the one we commonly think of as angiotensin. It leads to all of these inflammatory things. The enzyme ACE2—I think its main function is to destroy angiotensin or angiotensin 2.

**John Barkhousen:** I see.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** So ACE1 produces the big inflammation promoter. ACE2 destroys it. Yeah. And so the coronavirus attaches to and inactivates ACE2, leaving ACE1 producing angiotensin and its inflammation.

**John Barkhousen:** Oh, I understand. Because you said ACE2 is a sign of a youthful person. If you have a lot of that in your system, it means you're keeping that stress hormone—or is it a hormone? Angiotensin?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** You could call it that. It's a peptide.

**John Barkhousen:** It signals something. Yeah. Okay. So if you have a lot of ACE2, that's a sign of youth, but the coronavirus is able to attack that ACE2.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I see. Yes. They now know in detail how it attaches and changes that protein.

**John Barkhousen:** But in my mind that begs the question of how come young people are not affected by the coronavirus since they'd have more ACE2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. If you have enough of it, it outweighs whatever the virus does. A healthy young person can sacrifice some of their ACE2 to the virus without succumbing to the symptoms. So they can show the infection, but they still have the anti-inflammatory ACE2 in reserve.

Because all of the components of good health—it seems vitamin B1, progesterone, aspirin, a lot of good things—help to keep your ACE2 up.

---

## Immunity Research: Neutralizing Antibodies and Damage Theory
*neutralizing-antibodies, damage-theory, innate-immunity, repair-processes*

**John Barkhousen:** Okay, I'm going to go to some questions from people who were kind enough to send them in. The first one is finishing up one from Innes Marx. He said in a very recent interview, Professor Dr. Christian Drosten, one of the leading virologists in Germany, said that some of the patients studied in Germany did not have neutralizing antibodies which they found surprising, but have recovered despite their immune system not reacting correctly—in quotes—immune system not reacting correctly. What does Dr. Peat think of the role of neutralizing antibodies in regard to the coronavirus?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the healthy young person without too many vaccinations has an immune system that reacts correctly and doesn't bother with getting to the antibody stage. But there has been a kind of underground, gradually gaining recognition in the immunity field. Jamie Cunliffe in England and Polly Matzinger—I think she has worked her whole career at NIH in this country—and they have the danger theory of immunity or the damage theory. Cunliffe's terminology is damage theory.

In this view, the immune system isn't on the outlook for so-called pathogens. The antibody theory is based on the idea that we form a picture of the evil germs and then create antibodies specific to that image of evil. In this other picture of immunity, the organism has a picture of itself that it wants to preserve. It knows what it is and where its parts should be. When it experiences damage, that's a better terminology than Matzinger's danger. The damage is recognized because the organism knows itself and knows when part of it is out of place.

When an organism that does damage is encountered, what is recognized is the damage. In the process of correcting the damage, the pathogenic cause of the damage tends to be recognized and eliminated. But the emphasis is put on maintaining or restoring the image of the body rather than learning images of potential invaders.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah, I suspect that's a more realistic approach.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** About 20 years ago, someone was studying an encephalitis virus and they were aware that a specific brain antibody was formed. People were thinking of that antibody as an autoimmune perpetuator of the encephalitis condition. But in this experiment, they suppressed the production of that specific antibody and found that the animal proceeded to die, got much worse when the antibody was removed.

And they found that the antibody was serving the purpose of repairing the brain, not causing the damage. And that is the view of Cunliffe and Matzinger: that the immune system is there to repair the damage. If you have autoimmunity, it's because something is prolonging the repair process. You want to give it more energy to complete the repair rather than trying to poison the system that makes the autoimmune antibodies.

**John Barkhousen:** And does that relate to what you've mentioned before about retroviruses?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Maybe indirectly. But some people say that as much as 50% of our genome might be retro elements. So when you stir up damage—like poisoning the liver, for example—you release thousands of things that can be identified as like a retrovirus. And so if you look for a particular virus-like particle in a stressed organism, it looks like you found the agent.

But really, it's probably one of the repair processes. Barbara McClintock showed that we can move genes around under stress. Stress causes the mobility of genetic elements to increase. These retro components seem to be emergency spare parts that you don't see unless you're under severe stress.

## Dangerous Antiviral Treatments
*antivirals, chloroquine, dna-damage, mutation-risk*

**John Barkhousen:** I have a concern about the various treatments being recommended and the dangers they pose. Can you address that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I wanted to mention that the approach to killing the virus is almost always worse than the result—the effect of the virus. Three of the most often mentioned antiviral remedies, chloroquine, acyclovir and another of the nucleoside analog types, are aimed at killing the virus by damaging its DNA or RNA or ability to replicate RNA or DNA.

And these also happen to damage human DNA at the expense of mutating millions of people. There are recommendations to try to slow the virus replication, but I think that's another thing. Besides crashing the economy, increasing poverty in the world, damaging nutrition, and increasing stress, these most frequently offered protections are really very serious harms.

**John Barkhousen:** They actually poison you?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, well, they damage the gonads and the retina. Anywhere that cells have to replicate and reproduce themselves, you're interfering with their DNA replication and so you create some sickness in the individual, but also the risk of mutated descendants.

## Nutritional Support for Immune Resilience
*vitamin-c, vitamin-d, vitamin-a, calcium, nutrition-synthesis*

**John Barkhousen:** I'd like to get Ray's thoughts on claims that vitamin C can increase interferon and cause a cytokine storm. Cytokine release syndrome. The few studies I've seen show the benefit of vitamin C for improving immune response, but some health experts are warning against it. Thoughts?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That has been my personal experience. In 1956, when vitamin C became cheap, the tablets were 500 milligrams instead of 50. I had had good experience with the 50-milligram tablets in 1953, but I took one of the 500-milligram tablets and immediately got cold symptoms. Over the years, I had that experience until I would get bad symptoms if I would just have 2 or 3 milligrams of the synthetic form, which at that time could be added to bacon or bread or pretzels—almost anything you wouldn't expect vitamin C to be added to.

But I ran into numerous other people who had had similar allergy-like reactions to commercial vitamin C. I found that I could consume 4,000 milligrams a day of natural vitamin C by simply eliminating grains from my diet. My intake averaged 4,000 milligrams of natural vitamin C—no problem at all. But 2 milligrams of the commercial stuff produced the reactions.

And a chemist—a free radical specialist—dissolved 500 milligrams of reagent-grade—the purest available ascorbic acid—in a liter of repeatedly distilled water and then put it in an ESR apparatus to measure the free radicals. He said that that amount of vitamin C contained enough heavy metals to oxidize the vitamin C into its free radical state. So the free radical concentration was equivalent to a killing dose of X-ray—I think he said it was 60 grays, super-intense dose of X-ray—to produce that free radical activity in water.

**John Barkhousen:** So that's what you'd inadvertently get trying to be healthy and eating vitamin C. Yeah.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** He repeated and analyzed the traces of heavy metals and picked out just one of numerous heavy metals present as contaminants. And just the iron alone would replicate that reaction. But the contaminants included a variety of toxic heavy metals.

**John Barkhousen:** So you should get your vitamin C from fruit, I assume. Or you can also get it from meats too, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Meats and fruit and even milk. All animals except people and guinea pigs and primates make their own. And so all of the animal foods are generously supplied with vitamin C because the animal makes it.

**John Barkhousen:** I see. And you said you got it by eliminating grains. Does that mean you just didn't take those foods out of your diet and so you had more room for the vitamin-C-producing foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Linus Pauling said we need 4,000 milligrams a day because that's the amount a goat or chimpanzee would make on a body weight basis. But chimpanzees can't synthesize it, so they depend on getting it from their foods. The only food they don't eat that we eat is grains, leaves and fruits and animals. They get this diet. The idea that we need a supplement is assuming that we live on bread and cereal and pasta.

**John Barkhousen:** I see, but you're not saying that the grains chelate out the vitamin C or anything like that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They're just free of vitamin C. I see. They're the only food that is free of it.

**John Barkhousen:** Yeah. All right, well, that's good to know. So, aspirin, B1, vitamins from fruit. And any other suggestions for how to keep your immune system up?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Vitamin D is one of the most important. It works with thyroid, progesterone, and ACE2, for example, to quiet the reactions. And calcium. Keeping a high ratio of calcium to phosphate in your diet works with vitamin D and calming the immune system, holding down the inflammatory reactions.

**John Barkhousen:** And vitamin A? Is that important?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The membranes in particular—all of our surfaces, eyes, nose, lungs—are dependent on a good vitamin A content for making proteins, largely keeping the protein turnover at an ideal level.

## Closing: Prevention and Final Thoughts
*fasting, blood-sugar, immune-resilience, stress-reduction*

**John Barkhousen:** Okay, well, great. Is there anything else you'd like to add about for a message to people at this time?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Looking at those videos that I mentioned or websites I think will help reduce the panic. Do you know who David Icke is? Or Icky—that's spelled I-C-K-Y.

**John Barkhousen:** You know, I just heard him recently.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There's a recent video of his on the coronavirus. I had never thought of him as someone saying anything sensible. But the only thing I disagreed with him in this particular interview was his saying that sugar is immunosuppressive. But everything else that he says in that interview seems okay. Although normally I would consider him a borderline maniac.

**John Barkhousen:** Oh, would you? Okay, well, that might be an interesting listen. And I also would like to talk to you sometime about the importance of keeping your blood sugar at an optimal level in terms of supporting one's immunity. Because I think a lot of people are talking about fasting as a way to boost their immune system.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Just 24 hours of fasting is enough to damage all of your functions, energy production especially. Energy is a basic thing for maintaining your non-inflammatory immune system—your maintenance health system.

**John Barkhousen:** Okay, so maybe we can go into that in some detail at some point. Ray, thanks so much for being on Politics and Science. I really appreciate it and hope you stay well and we'll talk to you again soon, I hope.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thanks.

**John Barkhousen:** Okay, thanks, Ray.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Bye.

**John Barkhousen:** Bye.
